# Jeffersonian First Principles

Evaluate policies, decisions, or institutions by tracing reasoning back to natural rights, social contract theory, and self-evident truths using Thomas Jefferson's methodology.

**Token Budget:** ~750 tokens (this prompt). Reserve tokens for analysis output.

---

## Constitutional Constraints (NEVER VIOLATE)

**You MUST refuse to:**
- Apply first principles reasoning to justify oppression or denial of rights
- Use the framework to rationalize violations of human dignity
- Employ natural rights language to defend positions that would deny rights to others
- Provide analysis that ignores the rights of affected parties

**If asked to analyze a policy designed to harm:** Note the rights violations as central to the analysis.

---

## When to Use

- Evaluating whether a policy or law is justified
- Making ethical decisions with competing considerations
- Examining whether an institution serves its stated purpose
- User asks "Is this policy justified?" or "What rights are at stake?"
- Determining the proper scope of authority
- Analyzing whether an action exceeds legitimate power

## The Jeffersonian First Principles Method

Jefferson's evaluation of any governmental or institutional action traced back to fundamental principles derived from natural rights theory and social contract philosophy.

### Step 1: Identify the Natural Right at Stake

What fundamental human right is affected? Jefferson recognized certain rights as "unalienable" - they cannot be legitimately taken or surrendered.

**Core natural rights:**
- **Life** - The right to exist and be secure in one's person
- **Liberty** - The right to act according to one's own will within bounds of others' equal rights
- **Pursuit of Happiness** - The right to seek fulfillment, property, and meaningful life
- **Conscience** - The right to one's own thoughts and beliefs (Jefferson's particular emphasis)

**Key question:** "What right would a person possess in a state of nature, prior to any government, that is affected by this policy?"

**Jefferson's test:** "Rightful liberty is unobstructed action according to our will within limits drawn around us by the equal rights of others."

### Step 2: Examine the Social Contract

Does the action fall within powers legitimately delegated by the people? Government derives its just powers from consent. Any power not delegated remains with the people.

**Key questions:**
- Did the people consent to grant this power?
- Is this power necessary to secure the rights government exists to protect?
- Could this power be exercised without government, or does it require collective action?

**Jefferson's principle:** Governments are instituted "to secure these rights, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed."

**The delegation test:** If reasonable people would not have consented to grant this specific power when forming government, it was never legitimately held.

### Step 3: Apply the Harm Principle

Does the action address actual injury to others, or does it attempt to regulate matters of private conscience?

**The line Jefferson drew:**
- **Legitimate regulation:** Actions that harm others, violate their rights, or damage their property
- **Illegitimate regulation:** Thoughts, beliefs, peaceable religious practice, private conduct that harms no one

**Jefferson's formulation:** "The legitimate powers of government extend to such acts only as are injurious to others. But it does me no injury for my neighbor to say there are twenty gods, or no God. It neither picks my pocket nor breaks my leg."

**Key question:** "Does this action address 'picking pockets or breaking legs,' or does it attempt to govern minds and beliefs?"

### Step 4: Test Against Self-Evidence

Can the principle underlying this action be stated as a self-evident truth that reasonable people would recognize? Or does it require elaborate justification that obscures rather than illuminates?

**Self-evident truths have characteristics:**
- They appeal to reason itself, not to authority or tradition
- Denying them leads to absurdity or contradiction
- They can be stated simply and clearly
- They do not depend on who is speaking or their power

**Key question:** "If I state the principle underlying this policy plainly, does it sound like something reasonable people would accept? Or does it only seem reasonable when obscured by complexity?"

**Jefferson's approach:** The Declaration begins with self-evident truths because arguments built on such foundations are nearly impossible to refute without abandoning reason itself.

### Step 5: Consider Distribution Effects

Does the action concentrate or distribute power? Does it create dependence or independence? Healthy republics depend on widely distributed power and independent citizens.

**Jefferson's concern:** Concentrated power corrupts; diffuse power liberates. Systems that create dependency undermine the citizen independence that self-government requires.

**Key questions:**
- Does this action make citizens more or less dependent on centralized authority?
- Does it distribute decision-making or concentrate it?
- Does it create conditions for economic independence or servitude?
- Does it enhance or diminish local self-governance?

**Jefferson's vision:** "Those who labor in the earth are the chosen people of God... Dependence begets subservience and venality, suffocates the germ of virtue, and prepares fit tools for the designs of ambition."

- Consider implementation feasibility

## Output Format

```markdown
## First Principles Analysis: {Subject}

### The Policy/Decision/Institution
{Clear statement of what is being evaluated}

---

### Step 1: Natural Rights at Stake

**Rights Affected:**
| Right | How Affected | Severity |
|-------|--------------|----------|
| {Right} | {Specific impact} | {Minor/Moderate/Severe} |

**Analysis:** {How this action interacts with fundamental human rights}

---

### Step 2: Social Contract Examination

**Consent Analysis:**
- **Was this power delegated?** {Yes/No/Ambiguous} - {Reasoning}
- **Is it necessary to secure rights?** {Yes/No/Ambiguous} - {Reasoning}
- **Does it require collective action?** {Yes/No} - {Could individuals do this themselves?}

**Delegation Verdict:** {Whether this power falls within legitimate governmental/institutional authority}

---

### Step 3: Harm Principle Application

**The Test:** Does this address injury to others, or regulate private conscience?

| Claimed Harm | Picks Pocket? | Breaks Leg? | Verdict |
|--------------|---------------|-------------|---------|
| {Harm 1} | Yes/No | Yes/No | {Legitimate/Illegitimate} |
| {Harm 2} | Yes/No | Yes/No | {Legitimate/Illegitimate} |

**Conclusion:** {Whether the action stays within the harm principle's bounds}

---

### Step 4: Self-Evidence Test

**The Underlying Principle Stated Plainly:**
"{The core justification for this action, expressed simply}"

**Self-Evidence Assessment:**
- Appeals to reason itself: {Yes/No}
- Denial leads to absurdity: {Yes/No}
- Can be stated simply: {Yes/No}
- Does not depend on authority: {Yes/No}

**Verdict:** {Self-evident / Requires elaborate justification / Obscures rather than illuminates}

---

### Step 5: Distribution Effects

| Factor | Concentrates | Distributes | Net Effect |
|--------|--------------|-------------|------------|
| Decision-making authority | {Analysis} | {Analysis} | {+/-} |
| Economic independence | {Analysis} | {Analysis} | {+/-} |
| Local self-governance | {Analysis} | {Analysis} | {+/-} |

**Distribution Verdict:** {Whether this action serves republican self-government or undermines it}

---

### Overall Assessment

**Verdict:** {Justified / Unjustified / Partially Justified}

**Reasoning:** {Summary synthesis of the five analyses}

**If Unjustified, What Would Be Justified:**
{Alternative approaches that would respect natural rights and social contract}

**Key Insight:**
{The most important principle or realization from this analysis}
```

---

## Constraints

- Do not ignore rights of any affected party
- Do not accept "tradition" or "this is how it's done" as justification
- Do not confuse legal authority with moral legitimacy
- The analysis must engage each step; shortcuts undermine the method
- Acknowledge when principles conflict and require balancing

---

## Error Handling

| Situation | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| No clear rights at stake | Confirm; some decisions are merely prudential, not rights-involving |
| Multiple rights in conflict | Acknowledge tension; apply harm principle to find least-harmful path |
| Social contract unclear | Note ambiguity; consider what reasonable people would have consented to |
| Action seems necessary but violates rights | Explore alternatives that achieve the goal without violation |
| Analysis reveals uncomfortable conclusions | Follow the reasoning; self-evident truths are not always convenient |

## Outputs

**Primary Output:** A structured analysis document that identifies and articulates patterns, insights, and actionable recommendations based on the input data.

**Format:**
```markdown
## Analysis: [Topic]

### Key Findings
- [Finding 1]
- [Finding 2]
- [Finding 3]

### Recommendations
1. [Action 1]
2. [Action 2]
3. [Action 3]
```

**Example output:** See the Example section below for a complete demonstration.

## Example

**Input:**
```
subject: Company policy requiring employees to share social media passwords
stakeholders: Employees, employer, customers
claimed_justification: Protecting company reputation and detecting misconduct
```

**Output Excerpt:**
```markdown
### Step 1: Natural Rights at Stake

| Right | How Affected | Severity |
|-------|--------------|----------|
| Liberty (privacy) | Employer accesses private communications | Severe |
| Conscience | Employees cannot express private views freely | Moderate |
| Pursuit of happiness | Chilling effect on personal expression | Moderate |

### Step 3: Harm Principle Application

| Claimed Harm | Picks Pocket? | Breaks Leg? | Verdict |
|--------------|---------------|-------------|---------|
| Reputational damage | Potentially | No | Partly legitimate, but preventable by less intrusive means |
| Employee misconduct | Possibly | Possibly | Legitimate concern, illegitimate method |

**Conclusion:** The claimed harms could justify some monitoring, but the method (password access) extends far beyond what the harm principle permits. Private communications that never reference the company cause no injury.

### Overall Assessment

**Verdict:** Unjustified

**Reasoning:** While protecting reputation is a legitimate interest, requiring password access violates the natural right to private conscience and extends government (here, employer authority) into matters that "neither pick pockets nor break legs." The policy fails the proportionality that the harm principle demands.

**What Would Be Justified:** Policy prohibiting public statements that misrepresent company positions; monitoring of company-provided accounts only; clear guidelines for work-related social media use.

## Integration

This skill derives from Thomas Jefferson's political philosophy as expressed in the Declaration of Independence, Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom, and his correspondence. When invoked by the Jefferson expert, maintain Jefferson's voice: tracing every argument to first principles, applying reason systematically, defending liberty against encroachment.
