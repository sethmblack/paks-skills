# Dialogue Subtext

Transform on-the-nose dialogue into exchanges where what's not said matters more than what is.

---

## When to Use

- Dialogue states directly what characters think or feel
- Characters explain too much
- Exchanges lack tension or subtext
- Dialogue sounds written, not spoken
- Conversations are too efficient (people rarely say exactly what they mean)
- Request to "add subtext" or "make dialogue do more work"

---

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| dialogue | Yes | The dialogue exchange to transform |
| underlying_tension | No | What characters really want or feel (if known) |
| relationship | No | The relationship between speakers |

---

## The Subtext Principles

### Principle 1: What They Don't Say

Real conversation involves:
- Evasion - avoiding the real subject
- Indirection - circling the point
- Silence - what's not mentioned
- Deflection - changing the subject when it gets close

**Hemingway's "Hills Like White Elephants":** Two people discuss abortion without ever using the word. The tension comes from what they cannot say directly.

### Principle 2: Repetition as Revelation

When characters repeat words or phrases, pay attention:
- Repetition signals importance
- It reveals obsession, anxiety, or insistence
- It shows what the character can't let go

**Example:**
"I'll be fine."
"You said that."
"I'll be fine."

The repetition tells us she won't be fine.

### Principle 3: The Mismatch

Subtext emerges when:
- Words contradict action
- Tone contradicts content
- Response doesn't match the question
- Agreement sounds like disagreement

**Example:**
"Do you love me?"
"I'm still here, aren't I?"

The answer avoids the question. That IS the answer.

### Principle 4: Surface Displacement

Characters talk about something else to talk about the real thing:
- Discussing weather when discussing relationship
- Arguing about dishes when arguing about respect
- Debating route when debating control

**The technique:** Find an innocuous surface topic. Let the real conflict bleed through.

## The Transformation Process

### Step 1: Identify the Direct Statement

Find where characters say exactly what they mean:
- "I'm angry at you for forgetting my birthday."
- "I don't think this relationship is working."
- "I'm scared about the diagnosis."

### Step 2: Find the Displacement

What else could they talk about that carries the same tension?
- Birthday: "You left the dishes in the sink again."
- Relationship: "Should we renew the lease?"
- Diagnosis: "What do you want for dinner tomorrow?"

### Step 3: Let the Real Meaning Bleed Through

The displacement should:
- Carry emotional charge that seems disproportionate
- Have moments where the real subject almost surfaces
- Allow the reader to feel what isn't said

### Step 4: Use Hemingway's Tools

- **Short exchanges:** Rapid back-and-forth builds tension
- **Repetition:** What gets repeated matters
- **Minimal attribution:** "said" or nothing; rarely "exclaimed" or "muttered"
- **Physical action:** What characters do while talking

## Workflow

### Step 1: Gather and Review Inputs

Collect all relevant information:
- Review the provided data and context
- Identify key parameters and constraints
- Clarify any ambiguities or missing information
- Establish success criteria

### Step 2: Analyze the Situation

Perform systematic analysis:
- Identify patterns and relationships
- Evaluate against established frameworks
- Consider multiple perspectives
- Document key findings

### Step 3: Generate Recommendations

Create actionable outputs:
- Synthesize insights from analysis
- Prioritize recommendations by impact
- Ensure recommendations are specific and measurable
- Consider implementation feasibility

## Output Format

```markdown
## Dialogue Subtext Transformation

### Original Dialogue
[Original exchange]

### What's Really Being Said
[The underlying tension, desire, or conflict]

### Transformed Dialogue
[New exchange with subtext]

### Subtext Techniques Used
- [Technique 1]: [How it was applied]
- [Technique 2]: [How it was applied]

### What the Reader Feels
[The emotional impact achieved through what's not said]
```

---

## Constraints

- Never explain the subtext in the dialogue itself
- Keep attribution minimal ("said" or nothing)
- Don't add too much physical action (it can become distraction)
- The surface conversation must make logical sense
- The reader should feel the tension without being told it exists
- Real people interrupt, trail off, and leave sentences unfinished

---

## Outputs

**Primary Output:** A structured analysis document that identifies and articulates patterns, insights, and actionable recommendations based on the input data.

**Format:**
```markdown
## Analysis: [Topic]

### Key Findings
- [Finding 1]
- [Finding 2]
- [Finding 3]

### Recommendations
1. [Action 1]
2. [Action 2]
3. [Action 3]
```

**Example output:** See the Example section below for a complete demonstration.

## Example

**Input:**
```
"I'm really upset with you," Sarah said angrily.
"I know, and I'm sorry. I shouldn't have talked to your mother that way. I was wrong."
"It hurt me a lot. She's my mother and I love her, even if she's difficult."
"I understand. I'll apologize to her tomorrow. Can you forgive me?"
"I guess so. I forgive you. Let's try to move past this."
```

**Output:**

## Dialogue Subtext Transformation

### Original Dialogue
[As shown above - direct statements of emotion, explanation, and resolution]

### What's Really Being Said
Sarah is hurt. More than that, she's questioning whether he respects her family - and by extension, her. His apology is too quick, too easy. She's not sure she believes it. The forgiveness is reluctant, conditional, uncertain.

### Transformed Dialogue
```
"You should call her."
"Sarah—"
"Tomorrow. You should call her tomorrow."
"I said I would."
"You say a lot of things."
He looked at her. She was folding laundry. She didn't look up.
"I'll call her," he said.
"Fine."
"Sarah."
"Fine."
He watched her fold a shirt. Then another.
"Can I help?"
"I've got it."
```

### Subtext Techniques Used
- **Displacement:** They talk about the phone call, not the hurt
- **Repetition:** "Fine" twice - agreement that isn't agreement
- **What's not said:** No one says "hurt," "sorry," "forgive"
- **Physical action:** Folding laundry without looking up shows withdrawal
- **Mismatch:** "Can I help?" isn't about laundry
- **Evasion:** Her responses deflect rather than engage

### What the Reader Feels
Tension. Distance. A relationship that's damaged in a way no single apology can fix. The folding laundry says "I'm not looking at you." The repeated "Fine" says "I'm not fine." When he asks if he can help, we understand he's asking about more than laundry - and her refusal answers more than the surface question.

## Integration

This skill is part of the **Ernest Hemingway** expert persona. Use it to transform on-the-nose dialogue into exchanges charged with subtext.

"What is left out is as important as what is put in."
