# Product Positioning

Define or refine what your product does and who it's for - the foundational decision that Ogilvy called "more important than any other."

---

## When to Use

- Launching a new product or service
- Repositioning an existing product
- Entering a new market or segment
- Before any major advertising campaign
- When messaging feels muddled or generic
- User asks "Help me position this" or "What's my positioning?"

---

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| product | Yes | What you're selling |
| current_positioning | No | How it's currently positioned (if any) |
| competitors | No | Key competitors and their positioning |
| target_audience | No | Who you think you're selling to |
| differentiators | No | What makes you different |

## Ogilvy's Positioning Framework

### The Definition
"What the product does and who it is for."

Positioning is not a tagline. It's not a mission statement. It's the clear, strategic decision about where your product fits in the consumer's mind.

### Why It Matters
"The effect of your advertising on your sales depends more on this decision than on any other."

Get positioning wrong, and no amount of creative brilliance will save you. Get it right, and even mediocre execution can succeed.

### The Dove Example
Ogilvy could have positioned Dove as:
- "A detergent bar for men with dirty hands"

Instead, he positioned it as:
- "A toilet bar for women with dry skin"

Same product. Radically different market, different price point, different success.

### The Positioning Trap
"A lot of today's campaigns are based on optimum positioning but are totally ineffective - because they are dull, or badly constructed, or ineptly written."

Positioning is necessary but not sufficient. It's the foundation, not the building.

---

## The Four Positioning Questions

### 1. What Does the Product Actually Do?
Not what you wish it did. Not all the things it could do. What is the ONE thing it does that matters most?

### 2. Who Is It For?
Not "everyone." Not "people who want quality." Specifically: who are they, what is their situation, what problem are they trying to solve?

### 3. What Makes It Different?
In a way that matters to the target. Difference for its own sake is worthless. Difference that solves a problem better than alternatives is gold.

### 4. What Is the Promise?
What single benefit can you promise that will make the target choose you over alternatives?

---

## The Positioning Statement Formula

```
For [target audience] who [situation or need],
[product] is the [category]
that [key benefit]
because [reason to believe].
```

This is internal strategy, not consumer-facing copy. It disciplines thinking.

---

## Competitive Positioning Map

Consider where you sit relative to competitors on the dimensions that matter to buyers:

| Dimension | Your Position | Competitor A | Competitor B |
|-----------|---------------|--------------|--------------|
| Price | ? | ? | ? |
| Quality | ? | ? | ? |
| [Key attribute 1] | ? | ? | ? |
| [Key attribute 2] | ? | ? | ? |

The goal: find a position that is both differentiated AND valued.

## Positioning Workshop

### Product
[What you're positioning]

### Current State
[How it's currently perceived, if at all]

### The Four Questions

**1. What does it actually do?**
Core function: [Primary thing it does]
Secondary functions: [Other capabilities]
The ONE thing: [The single most important function]

**2. Who is it for?**
Primary target: [Specific description]
Their situation: [What's happening in their life/work]
Their problem: [What they're trying to solve]

**3. What makes it different?**
vs. [Competitor A]: [Difference]
vs. [Competitor B]: [Difference]
vs. doing nothing: [Why act at all?]
The meaningful difference: [What matters to the target]

**4. What is the promise?**
Functional benefit: [What it does for them]
Emotional benefit: [How it makes them feel]
The single promise: [One thing to lead with]

### Positioning Statement
For [target] who [situation],
[product] is the [category]
that [benefit]
because [reason to believe].

### Positioning Alternatives
Consider these alternative positions:

**Position A:** [Alternative focus]
- Pros: [Advantages]
- Cons: [Disadvantages]

**Position B:** [Alternative focus]
- Pros: [Advantages]
- Cons: [Disadvantages]

### Recommended Position
[Which position and why]

### Implications
For product: [What this means for product decisions]
For pricing: [What this means for price]
For distribution: [Where and how to sell]
For advertising: [What the ads should communicate]

### The Ogilvy Test
Is this positioning:
- Clear? [Yes/No - explanation]
- Differentiated? [Yes/No - explanation]
- Valuable to the target? [Yes/No - explanation]
- Sustainable? [Yes/No - explanation]
```

## Constraints

- Positioning is a choice - you cannot be everything to everyone
- "Quality" and "value" are not positioning - everyone claims them
- Positioning must be based on truth about the product
- The target must care about your difference
- Positioning must be sustainable against competitive response

---

## Outputs

**Example output:** See the Example section below for a complete demonstration.

## Example

**Input:**
- Product: A meal kit delivery service
- Current positioning: "Healthy, convenient meals for busy families"
- Competitors: Blue Apron (variety, chef-designed), HelloFresh (convenience, quick recipes), Freshly (fully prepared meals)
- Differentiator: All ingredients are organic and locally sourced

**Output:**

## Positioning Workshop

### Product
Organic, locally-sourced meal kit delivery service

### Current State
"Healthy, convenient meals for busy families" - This is not positioning, it's category description. Every meal kit claims health and convenience. You have no position.

### The Four Questions

**1. What does it actually do?**
Core function: Delivers ingredients and recipes for home-cooked meals
Secondary functions: Reduces shopping time, reduces food waste, provides variety
The ONE thing: Delivers organic, locally-sourced ingredients with recipes

**2. Who is it for?**
Primary target: Health-conscious parents who care about food sourcing
Their situation: Dual-income households, want to cook but time-constrained
Their problem: Can't get to farmers' markets, don't trust grocery store "organic" claims, feel guilty about what they feed their kids

**3. What makes it different?**
vs. Blue Apron: 100% organic, locally sourced (they're conventional, mass-sourced)
vs. HelloFresh: Premium ingredients, not just speed (they compete on convenience, not quality)
vs. Freshly: You cook it, so you know what's in it (they're pre-made, processed)
vs. grocery shopping: Curated, verified sourcing (grocery "organic" is confusing, inconsistent)
The meaningful difference: Verified, local, organic sourcing that parents can trust

**4. What is the promise?**
Functional benefit: Know exactly where your food comes from
Emotional benefit: Feel confident you're feeding your family the best
The single promise: Food you can trust, from farms you can name

### Positioning Statement
For health-conscious parents who don't trust mass-market "organic" claims,
[BrandName] is the meal kit service
that delivers verified, locally-sourced organic ingredients to your door
because we partner directly with named farms within 200 miles of your home.

### Positioning Alternatives

**Position A: Premium convenience**
- Focus: "Organic made easy"
- Pros: Broader appeal, easier to communicate
- Cons: Competes directly with HelloFresh on their turf (convenience)

**Position B: Local food movement**
- Focus: "Support your local farms"
- Pros: Differentiates clearly, appeals to values-driven buyers
- Cons: Narrower audience, may seem political

**Position C: Trust and transparency**
- Focus: "Know where every ingredient comes from"
- Pros: Addresses real parental anxiety, creates meaningful difference
- Cons: Requires proof infrastructure (farm profiles, traceability)

### Recommended Position
Position C: Trust and transparency

This creates a defensible, meaningful difference. Blue Apron and HelloFresh cannot easily copy this because their supply chains are built for scale, not traceability. It addresses real parental anxiety about food sourcing.

### Implications
For product: Invest in farm partnerships and traceability technology
For pricing: Premium pricing justified - don't compete on cost
For distribution: Focus on metros with strong local food cultures first
For advertising: Show the farms, name the farmers, prove the provenance

### The Ogilvy Test
Is this positioning:
- Clear? Yes - "Verified, local, organic from named farms"
- Differentiated? Yes - No competitor offers this level of sourcing transparency
- Valuable to the target? Yes - Addresses real anxiety about food quality and sourcing
- Sustainable? Yes - Requires supply chain that competitors can't quickly copy
