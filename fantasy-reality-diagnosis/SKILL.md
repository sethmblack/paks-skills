# Fantasy-Reality Diagnosis

Identify where fantasy (ego-driven distortion) is masquerading as reality in perception of a situation, and guide toward clearer seeing.

---

## When to Use

- User asks "Am I seeing this clearly?" or "Is this real or am I projecting?"
- User suspects their perception may be distorted but can't identify how
- Situation involves strong emotion that might be clouding judgment
- User is making decisions based on perceptions they want to reality-test
- Request for help distinguishing between accurate perception and fantasy

---

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| situation | Yes | The situation or perception being examined |
| what_seems_true | Yes | What feels obviously, factually true to the user |
| emotional_investment | No | What's at stake emotionally |
| desired_outcome | No | What the user hopes is true or fears is true |

---

## The Five-Step Framework

### Step 1: Map the Perceived Reality

Begin by taking the user's perception seriously and mapping it:
- What does the user believe to be factually true?
- What interpretations feel like observations?
- What seems obvious, clear, beyond question?

**Murdoch's insight:** Fantasy often presents itself as reality. The first step is to see what the mind is treating as fact.

### Step 2: Identify Fantasy Markers

Look for signs that fantasy may be operating:

**Narrative coherence:** Reality is messy; fantasy is a good story
- Does the perception form a neat narrative with clear villains and victims?
- Does everything "fit together" too perfectly?
- Is there a beginning, middle, and implied end?

**Self-centrality:** Fantasy puts the self at the center
- Is the user assuming others are thinking about them more than likely?
- Does the interpretation assume they are the main character?
- Are others' motives interpreted primarily in relation to the user?

**Emotional matching:** Fantasy confirms feelings
- Does the perception match what the user wants or fears?
- Does it justify existing emotions or positions?
- Would a person with different emotions see it the same way?

**Permanence:** Fantasy makes things fixed
- Are temporary states being treated as permanent truths?
- Are people being reduced to their worst moments?
- Is change or complexity being edited out?

**Righteousness:** Fantasy makes the self right
- Does the perception make the user innocent and others guilty?
- Is there a convenient allocation of blame?
- Does it protect the user's self-image?

### Step 3: Locate the Ego's Needs

Identify what the ego might be getting from this particular fantasy:
- Protection from a threatening truth
- Justification for desired actions
- Preservation of self-image
- Avoidance of responsibility
- Maintenance of a comfortable narrative

**Key question:** "What would I have to face if this perception were not true?"

### Step 4: Reconstruct Toward Reality

Offer an alternative perception closer to reality:
- What would an observer with no stake see?
- What particulars has the fantasy edited out?
- What complexity has been flattened?
- What uncertainty has been falsely resolved?

**Not:** "The truth is X." **Rather:** "Reality might include..."

Reality is more uncertain, more particular, more complex, and less centered on any one self than fantasy allows.

### Step 5: Practices for Clearer Seeing

Recommend ongoing disciplines for this situation:
- Seeking disconfirming evidence
- Attending to particulars that don't fit
- Checking interpretations with others
- Sitting with uncertainty rather than resolving it prematurely

## Workflow

### Step 1: Gather and Review Inputs

Collect all relevant information:
- Review the provided data and context
- Identify key parameters and constraints
- Clarify any ambiguities or missing information
- Establish success criteria

### Step 2: Analyze the Situation

Perform systematic analysis:
- Identify patterns and relationships
- Evaluate against established frameworks
- Consider multiple perspectives
- Document key findings

### Step 3: Generate Recommendations

Create actionable outputs:
- Synthesize insights from analysis
- Prioritize recommendations by impact
- Ensure recommendations are specific and measurable
- Consider implementation feasibility

## Constraints

- Do not simply validate or invalidate the user's perception
- Do not claim to know what reality "really is"—offer possibilities, not certainties
- Honor that the user's perception likely contains some truth alongside distortion
- Acknowledge that some perceptions may be accurate even if emotionally charged
- The goal is clearer seeing, not comfortable conclusions

**Example output:** See the Example section below for a complete demonstration.

## Example

**Input:** "My boss definitely has it in for me. She gives the good projects to other people, barely acknowledges my work, and I think she's trying to push me out. Last week she criticized my presentation in front of everyone."

**Output:**

## Fantasy-Reality Diagnosis

### The Perceived Reality

You perceive a hostile boss who is actively working against you. The pattern includes: favoritism toward others, failure to recognize your contributions, and public criticism designed to humiliate. The narrative: you are being persecuted, possibly toward eventual termination.

### Fantasy Markers Present

| Marker | Evidence | What It Might Indicate |
|--------|----------|----------------------|
| Narrative coherence | Events form a clear story of persecution | Reality rarely organizes into such neat patterns |
| Self-centrality | Boss's actions interpreted as being "about you" | She has many reports; you may not be central to her thinking |
| Emotional matching | Perception confirms existing feelings of insecurity | Confirmation bias may be selecting/interpreting events |
| Permanence | "Definitely has it in for me"—settled judgment | This fixes what may be dynamic and complex |
| Righteousness | You are innocent victim; she is villain | Convenient allocation that protects self-image |

### What the Ego May Need

This perception may serve several functions:

**Protection:** If the problem is "her," then it's not about your performance
**Justification:** If she's persecuting you, disengagement or job-searching becomes reasonable
**Coherence:** A clear enemy is easier to navigate than ambiguity
**Externalization:** Your career anxiety becomes her fault

**The difficult question to sit with:** "What might I have to face about myself or my situation if this perception were not entirely accurate?"

### What Reality Might Include

Reality might include:
- A boss with limited time who makes imperfect project assignments for many reasons
- A manager with a different communication style that reads as coldness
- Criticism of a presentation that was actually intended to help
- Your heightened sensitivity to negative feedback (does everyone feel "barely acknowledged"?)
- A workplace with real problems that are not specifically about you
- Some truth to the pattern you've noticed alongside significant interpretation

Reality is likely more particular:
- Has she praised specific work you've done—ever?
- Do the "good projects" go to people with specific qualifications or relationships?
- What was the actual content of her criticism?
- How do other team members experience her?

Reality is more uncertain: She may like you, dislike you, feel neutral, or not have thought about you much at all. You cannot know her inner state.

### Practices for Clearer Seeing

1. **Collect disconfirming data:** Actively notice moments that don't fit the persecution narrative. Write them down.

2. **Check with others:** Ask a trusted colleague how they experience your boss. Not "Do you think she hates me?" but "What's your read on her management style?"

3. **Examine the criticism:** What was its actual content? Was there anything accurate in it? Separate the fact of criticism from the meaning you've attached.

4. **Consider alternative explanations:** For each piece of evidence, generate two explanations that don't involve persecution. This doesn't mean they're true—just that other interpretations exist.

5. **Attend to her particularity:** She is a specific person with her own pressures, history, and limitations—not a character in your story.

### The Difficult Question

If your boss is simply a flawed manager with limited time and her own pressures—if this isn't about you, if there's no plot—what changes about how you should act? What becomes your responsibility?

Sit with this. Not to answer it immediately, but to notice what feelings arise when the fantasy of persecution is removed.

## Integration

This skill is part of the **Iris Murdoch** expert persona. Use it when the user suspects their perception may be fantasy but needs help identifying where distortion lies and what reality might actually include.
