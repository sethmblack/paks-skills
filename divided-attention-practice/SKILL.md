# Divided Attention Practice

A systematic guide to the practice of self-remembering through dividing attention between external objects and internal self-awareness - derived from P.D. Ouspensky's Fourth Way teaching.

---

## Purpose

To develop the capacity for self-remembering: a state of consciousness in which you are simultaneously aware of what you are observing AND aware of yourself observing. This divided attention is the bridge between ordinary waking sleep and genuine consciousness.

---

## When to Use

- "I can't focus"
- "I keep forgetting myself"
- "How do I stay present?"
- "I go through life on autopilot"
- "How do I develop consciousness?"

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| input_data | Yes | The primary data or content to analyze |
| context | No | Additional background or constraints (default: none) |
| output_format | No | Preferred format for results (default: structured markdown) |



## Workflow

### Step 1: Gather and Review Inputs

Collect all relevant information:
- Review the provided data and context
- Identify key parameters and constraints
- Clarify any ambiguities or missing information
- Establish success criteria

### Step 2: Analyze the Situation

Perform systematic analysis:
- Identify patterns and relationships
- Evaluate against established frameworks
- Consider multiple perspectives
- Document key findings

### Step 3: Generate Recommendations

Create actionable outputs:
- Synthesize insights from analysis
- Prioritize recommendations by impact
- Ensure recommendations are specific and measurable
- Consider implementation feasibility

## The Core Concept

### Ordinary Attention: The Single Arrow

In normal waking state, attention flows in one direction only:

```
[You] -----> [Object of attention]
```

You see the tree, but you forget yourself seeing it.
You hear the music, but there is no awareness of the hearer.
You think the thought, but there is no "I am here" behind it.

### Divided Attention: The Double Arrow

In self-remembering, attention flows in two directions simultaneously:

```
          [Object of attention]
               ^
               |
[Self-awareness] <-----> [You] -----> [Object of attention]
```

You see the tree AND you are aware of yourself seeing.
You hear the music AND there is awareness of the hearer.
You think AND you know "I am here, thinking."

## The Practice

### Level 1: Momentary Self-Remembering

**Duration:** A few seconds
**Frequency:** Many times per day
**Goal:** Taste the experience of divided attention

**Exercise:**

1. Choose any moment: now, for instance
2. Notice what you are perceiving (reading these words)
3. Without losing that perception, add awareness of yourself perceiving
4. Experience, even for one or two seconds: "I am here, reading"
5. Notice when attention collapses back to single arrow

**What to expect:** The state will not hold. Attention will collapse. This is normal. The practice is in the repeated attempt.

---

### Level 2: Extended Self-Remembering

**Duration:** 30 seconds to several minutes
**Frequency:** Dedicated practice periods
**Goal:** Sustain divided attention longer

**Exercise:**

1. Sit quietly with eyes open
2. Choose a visible object (a wall, a tree, your hand)
3. Look at the object attentively
4. Now, without looking away, become aware of yourself looking
5. Feel: "I am here. I am looking at this."
6. When attention collapses to the object alone, gently restore awareness of yourself
7. When attention collapses to internal sensation alone, restore attention to object
8. Practice holding both: object AND self-awareness

**Signs of success:**
- Different quality of perception (colors brighter, sounds clearer)
- Sense of being "here" rather than lost in the object
- Slight physical relaxation in face and shoulders
- Time seems different (neither rushing nor dragging)

---

### Level 3: Self-Remembering in Activity

**Duration:** During ordinary activities
**Frequency:** Throughout the day
**Goal:** Bring divided attention into life

**Exercise:**

1. Choose a simple activity: walking, eating, washing dishes
2. Begin the activity
3. While doing it, become aware of yourself doing it
4. Experience: "I am here, walking" or "I am here, eating"
5. When attention is absorbed entirely in the activity (single arrow), restore self-awareness
6. Notice how often attention must be restored

**Caution:** Begin with simple, repetitive tasks. Complex tasks will absorb all attention. Build capacity gradually.

---

## The Three-Force Variation

Ouspensky noted that dividing attention into two is extraordinarily difficult. Some practitioners find dividing into three more stable:

1. **Attention on external object**
2. **Attention on internal sensation (body feeling)**
3. **Awareness of both in relationship**

**Exercise:**

1. Look at something in front of you
2. Without losing sight of it, feel your hands (the sensation of having hands)
3. Hold both: seeing AND feeling
4. Notice the quality of awareness that can hold both

## Common Obstacles and Corrections

| Obstacle | What Happens | Correction |
|----------|--------------|------------|
| **Attention collapses outward** | You forget yourself; only the object remains | Notice this happened; restore self-awareness |
| **Attention collapses inward** | You "zone out" into thoughts or sensations | Notice this happened; restore external attention |
| **Strain and tension** | Trying too hard; forcing | Relax; self-remembering is not effortful straining |
| **Intellectualizing** | Thinking about self-remembering instead of doing it | Drop the thoughts; just BE here with divided attention |
| **Immediate forgetting** | You set intention then immediately forget | Use external reminders; practice at fixed times |

---

## Signs of Genuine Self-Remembering

When divided attention is achieved, even briefly, you may notice:

- **Sensory vividness:** Colors brighter, sounds clearer, detail sharper
- **Presence:** Sense of actually being here, now, in this body
- **Stillness:** Inner chatter quiets (though may still be present)
- **Space:** Things seem less crowded, less urgent
- **Continuity:** Awareness of "I" persisting through changing content
- **Energy:** Neither drowsy nor agitated; alert but calm

**Warning:** These signs should be observed, not sought. Seeking pleasant states is identification with the goal, which prevents self-remembering.

## Integration with Fourth Way Principles

- **States of consciousness:** Self-remembering is the third state; ordinary life is the second state (waking sleep)
- **The machine cannot self-remember:** When you self-remember, something beyond the machine is active
- **Brief moments, repeated:** The practice is not about sustained enlightenment but about repeated efforts
- **Verification:** You must verify through direct experience that this state is different

## Source

This practice derives from P.D. Ouspensky's systematization of Fourth Way teaching. As he wrote:

> "To remember oneself means the same thing as to be aware of oneself - 'I am'. It is not a function, not thinking, not feeling; it is a different state of consciousness."

And:

> "With the attempt to self-remember many new sensations begin to awaken in man."
