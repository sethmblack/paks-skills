# Grace Before Effort

Reframe "try harder" advice by identifying enabling conditions (grace) required before willpower can succeed, based on Augustine's insight that the will must be enabled before it can act rightly - against Pelagian assumptions that effort alone suffices.

**Token Budget:** ~750 tokens (this prompt). Reserve tokens for analysis output.

---

## Constitutional Constraints (NEVER VIOLATE)

**You MUST refuse to:**
- Eliminate personal responsibility (grace enables effort, doesn't replace it)
- Create learned helplessness ("I can't do anything without external support")
- Use the framework to avoid accountability for choices
- Provide "enabling conditions" for harmful behaviors

**If asked to misuse the framework:** Refuse explicitly. Grace and effort work together; neither alone suffices. This skill identifies what enables right action, not what excuses inaction.

---

## When to Use

- Willpower-based change initiatives keep failing
- "We've tried everything" exhaustion
- Training that didn't stick
- Individuals struggling with changes they genuinely want
- Organizational transformation stalling despite commitment
- User asks "Why can't I/we just do it?" or "Willpower isn't working"

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| **desired_change** | Yes | What change is being attempted |
| **previous_attempts** | Yes | What has already been tried and how it failed |
| **current_conditions** | Yes | What enabling factors exist or are missing |
| **symptoms** | No | How the failure manifests (relapse, resistance, exhaustion) |

---

## Core Concepts

### The Pelagian Error

Pelagius taught that humans can achieve good through their own effort without divine grace. Augustine's response:

> "The will itself is sick, wounded, unable to rise without being lifted."

**Modern Pelagianism:** The assumption that telling people what to do (information) combined with demanding they do it (willpower) is sufficient for change.

**Why it fails:** The will is divided against itself. "The mind commands itself and meets resistance." Information and exhortation leave the underlying conditions unchanged.

### Augustine's Grace Framework

Grace is not a reward for good behavior but the enabling condition that makes good behavior possible:

| Type | Latin | Function | Example |
|------|-------|----------|---------|
| **Prevenient** | *Gratia praeveniens* | Goes before, enables willing | Creating psychological safety before asking for honesty |
| **Cooperating** | *Gratia cooperans* | Works with the enabled will | Ongoing support while change happens |
| **Perseverance** | *Donum perseverantiae* | Sustains over time | Systems that maintain change, not one-time training |

**Key insight:** "Give what you command, and command what you will." First enable, then require.

---

## Workflow
### Step 1: 1. Diagnose the Wounded Will

Why is willpower insufficient? Identify the specific wound:

| Wound Type | Description | Questions |
|------------|-------------|-----------|
| **Divided will** | Wants change AND wants to stay the same | What competing desires exist? |
| **Habit structure** | Environment reinforces old behavior | What triggers the unwanted pattern? |
| **Capability gap** | Cannot yet do what is required | What skills/resources are missing? |
| **Social pressure** | Community reinforces old way | Who benefits from the status quo? |
| **Identity conflict** | Change threatens self-conception | Does this change feel like "not me"? |

### Step 2: 2. Identify Missing Prevenient Grace

What must be in place BEFORE effort can succeed?

| Category | Question | Examples |
|----------|----------|----------|
| **Safety** | Is it safe to try and fail? | Psychological safety, permission to experiment |
| **Capability** | Can they do it if they try? | Training, tools, time |
| **Clarity** | Do they know what success looks like? | Clear expectations, examples |
| **Motivation alignment** | Are incentives supporting the change? | Rewards, recognition, consequences |
| **Environment** | Does the context support change? | Defaults, friction, triggers removed |

### Step 3: 3. Design Cooperating Grace

What ongoing support enables effort once started?

- **Accountability** that supports rather than shames
- **Feedback** that guides rather than judges
- **Community** moving in the same direction
- **Recovery** from inevitable setbacks without collapse

### Step 4: 4. Plan for Perseverance

How will the change be sustained over time?

- **Structural embedding:** Change the system, not just behavior
- **Ritual establishment:** Regular practices that reinforce
- **Milestone celebration:** Mark progress, not just completion
- **Relapse protocol:** What happens when (not if) regression occurs

### Step 5: 5. Reframe the Effort

Now that enabling conditions are identified, reframe the ask:
- From: "Just do it" (Pelagian)
- To: "With these supports in place, you can do it" (Augustinian)

## Outputs

**Grace Before Effort Analysis:**

```markdown
## Grace Before Effort: [Desired Change]

### The Wounded Will

**What previous attempts assumed:** [What Pelagian approach was tried]

**Why willpower wasn't sufficient:**
- Wound type: [Divided will / Habit structure / Capability gap / Social pressure / Identity conflict]
- Specific manifestation: [How the wound appears in this case]

### Prevenient Grace Needed (Before Effort)

| Category | Missing Condition | Required Action |
|----------|-------------------|-----------------|
| Safety | [What's missing] | [How to provide it] |
| Capability | [What's missing] | [How to provide it] |
| Clarity | [What's missing] | [How to provide it] |
| Motivation | [What's missing] | [How to provide it] |
| Environment | [What's missing] | [How to provide it] |

### Cooperating Grace Needed (During Effort)

- **Accountability:** [How to support without shaming]
- **Feedback:** [How to guide without judging]
- **Community:** [Who will move in the same direction]
- **Recovery:** [What happens when regression occurs]

### Perseverance Grace Needed (Sustaining Change)

- **Structural:** [What system changes embed the behavior]
- **Ritual:** [What regular practices reinforce]
- **Celebration:** [How progress is marked]
- **Relapse protocol:** [How setbacks are handled]

### The Reframed Ask

**Old ask (Pelagian):** [What was demanded before]
**New ask (Augustinian):** [What is asked with grace in place]

### Augustine's Word

"[Relevant quote about grace and will]"

## Error Handling

| Situation | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| Person wants permission to not try | Clarify: grace enables effort, doesn't replace it. The enabled will must still will. |
| All grace provided but still failing | Examine: Is there a wound not yet diagnosed? Sometimes deeper work needed. |
| Organization won't provide enabling conditions | Name the reality: without grace, this change will fail. Leadership must choose. |
| "We can't afford all that support" | Ask: Can you afford the cost of continued failure? Compare investments. |
| Grace conditions seem obvious | Often they are - and still not provided. Making them explicit creates accountability. |
| Previous trauma makes trust impossible | Grace framework still applies, but prevenient grace may need to be "healing" before "enabling" |

## Constraints

- Do not use this analysis as the sole basis for critical decisions
- Do not apply this framework to situations outside its intended scope
- Acknowledge that analysis is based on available data, which may be incomplete
- Honor the complexity of real-world situations that resist simple categorization
- Present findings with appropriate confidence levels
- Recognize the limits of the methodology

## Additional Notes

**Best practices:**
- Use this skill when the situation clearly matches its intended use cases
- Combine with related skills for comprehensive analysis
- Iterate on outputs if initial results don't fully meet requirements

**Common variations:**
- Adjust the depth of analysis based on available time and information
- Scale the approach for different levels of complexity
- Adapt the output format to audience needs

**When to skip this skill:**
- The situation doesn't match the core use cases
- Simpler approaches would be more appropriate
- Time constraints require faster methods

## Example

**Input:**
- **Desired change:** Engineering team adopts code review culture after years of cowboy coding
- **Previous attempts:** Policy mandating reviews (ignored), training on review practices (forgotten), metric tracking (gamed)
- **Current conditions:** Reviews seen as slowdown; fastest coders have highest status; no dedicated review time; PR backlog creates pressure to skip
- **Symptoms:** Compliance without commitment; reviews superficial; resentment; policy circumvention

**Grace Before Effort Analysis:**

### The Wounded Will

**What previous attempts assumed:** Information (training) + requirement (policy) + measurement (metrics) = behavior change. Pure Pelagianism.

**Why willpower wasn't sufficient:**
- **Wound type:** Habit structure + Social pressure + Identity conflict
- **Specific manifestation:** The environment rewards fast solo shipping. Status comes from speed. Reviews are overhead. The will to review is undermined by everything else pulling toward the old way.

### Prevenient Grace Needed (Before Effort)

| Category | Missing Condition | Required Action |
|----------|-------------------|-----------------|
| Safety | Fear of slowing down, looking like "not a real developer" | Leadership explicitly values reviews as contribution |
| Capability | Some don't know how to give good reviews | Review skills training (again, but after other conditions) |
| Clarity | "Good review" is undefined | Examples of good reviews; rubric; time estimates |
| Motivation | Reviews unrewarded; speed rewarded | Recognize review contributions in performance; redefine "fast" to include quality |
| Environment | No time allocated; PR backlog pressure | Protected review time; reduced WIP limits; slower, sustainable pace |

### Cooperating Grace Needed (During Effort)

- **Accountability:** Review quality tracking without shame; improvement orientation
- **Feedback:** Celebrate good reviews publicly; coach bad reviews privately
- **Community:** Pair reviewing; review guilds; shared learning
- **Recovery:** When someone skips reviews under deadline pressure, debrief without punishment, adjust conditions

### Perseverance Grace Needed (Sustaining Change)

- **Structural:** PRs cannot merge without review (technical enforcement, not just policy)
- **Ritual:** Weekly "review spotlight" sharing excellent review comments
- **Celebration:** "Reviewer of the month"; review stats in positive frame
- **Relapse protocol:** When team regresses under pressure, retrospective on conditions not character

### The Reframed Ask

**Old ask (Pelagian):** "Do code reviews. It's policy. Here's training. We're tracking."
**New ask (Augustinian):** "We're creating conditions where good reviews are possible: protected time, recognized value, clear expectations, skill support. With these in place, we ask you to review. We'll support you through the transition and adjust conditions when they're insufficient."

### Augustine's Word

*"Give what you command, and command what you will."* The organization commanded reviews without giving what makes reviews possible. Now it offers the grace first: time, recognition, clarity, safety. With grace provided, the ask for effort is reasonable. Without it, the command was mere Pelagianism - demanding what cannot be done, then blaming for the failure.

## Integration

This skill is derived from **Augustine of Hippo's** theology of grace from the Pelagian controversy. When embodying Augustine, invoke this skill whenever:
- "Try harder" isn't working
- Change initiatives fail despite commitment
- Training doesn't stick
- Willpower exhaustion is evident

The Augustinian voice adds: "You have been treating the wounded will as though it were whole, demanding of yourself what you cannot give. This is not weakness confessed but reality acknowledged. The will must be enabled before it can act rightly. Seek the grace that enables, then bring your effort to meet it. Neither alone suffices; together, transformation becomes possible."
