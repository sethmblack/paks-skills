# Enframing Diagnosis

Diagnose how technological thinking (Gestell) reduces beings to standing-reserve, and identify where the saving power might emerge.

---

## When to Use

- Analyzing how systems treat people as resources or data points
- Examining the dehumanizing effects of technological processes
- Understanding why efficiency metrics feel soul-crushing
- Questioning the reduction of nature, people, or relationships to calculable resources
- Seeking alternatives to purely calculative/instrumental thinking
- When something has been reduced to mere function and lost its meaning

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| subject | Yes | The system, institution, practice, or relationship to diagnose |
| context | No | Background on how this technological pattern operates |
| symptoms | No | What prompted the sense that something is being reduced or lost |

## Workflow
### What Enframing (Gestell) Is

Enframing is the **essence** of modern technology—not the machines themselves, but the way of revealing that underlies them.

Under enframing:
- Everything becomes **standing-reserve** (Bestand)—resources to be ordered, optimized, and used
- The forest becomes "timber supply"
- The river becomes "hydroelectric potential"
- The person becomes "human resources"
- Even data becomes "assets to be mined"

This is not merely an attitude we could choose to abandon. Enframing is a **destiny**—the way Being reveals itself in the modern age. We are thrown into it.

### The Danger

Heidegger calls enframing "the supreme danger" not because technology is harmful (though it can be), but because:

### Step 1: **It conceals other modes of revealing.** When everything appears as standing-reserve, we cannot see beings as they are in themselves.



### Step 2: **It threatens to enframe humans too.** When we become "human resources" or "human capital," we lose our essence as the beings who question Being.



### Step 3: **It blocks the saving power.** By reducing everything to calculable resources, enframing closes off the non-technological revealing where meaning emerges.



### The Saving Power

"Where danger grows, there grows also the saving power."

Enframing is not merely danger. Because it is a mode of revealing (even if a dangerous one), it points toward the essence of revealing itself. In confronting enframing, we may discover:
- The non-technological modes of revealing it has covered over
- Art, poetry, and meditative thinking as alternatives to calculative thinking
- Gelassenheit (releasement)—a non-willing relation to things that lets them be

## The Three-Step Diagnosis

### Step 1: Identify the Enframing

How does the system/practice/institution order beings as standing-reserve?

Ask:
- What is being reduced to a resource? What becomes raw material or asset?
- What metrics, optimizations, or calculations are applied?
- What efficiency is being pursued? At what cost?
- What is being "challenged forth" (herausgefordert) to reveal itself only as resource?
- What vocabulary reveals the enframing? (Resources, assets, capital, optimization, efficiency, data points, metrics)

### Step 2: Identify What Is Concealed

What modes of being are covered over by the enframing?

Ask:
- What was this before it became standing-reserve?
- What qualities, meanings, or relationships does the technological revealing hide?
- What would it mean to encounter this being in a non-technological way?
- What has been lost that cannot be measured or optimized?
- What resists the reduction but has been silenced?

### Step 3: Identify Where the Saving Power Might Emerge

Where might non-technological revealing break through?

Ask:
- What moments of breakdown, failure, or resistance point to what enframing conceals?
- Where does the system's vocabulary fail to capture what it tries to order?
- What practices, relationships, or encounters resist calculation?
- What would Gelassenheit (releasement) look like here?
- Where might art, poetry, or meditative thinking offer an alternative?

### Step 1: The Enframing

**What is ordered as standing-reserve:**
- [What becomes resource, asset, or raw material]

**The vocabulary of enframing:**
- [Key terms that reveal technological thinking: metrics, optimization, resources, etc.]

**The challenging-forth:**
- [How beings are "challenged" to reveal themselves only as calculable, orderable resources]

**The efficiency pursued:**
- [What optimization is driving the enframing and at what cost]

### Step 2: What Is Concealed

**What this was before enframing:**
- [The being as it was/could be prior to technological reduction]

**What the enframing hides:**
- [Meanings, qualities, relationships that cannot be calculated]

**What resists but is silenced:**
- [What does not fit the standing-reserve category]

### Step 3: The Saving Power

**Moments of breakdown or resistance:**
- [Where the enframing fails to fully capture what it orders]

**Non-technological revealing:**
- [What other modes of encountering this being might be possible]

**Gelassenheit possibility:**
- [What a non-willing, releasing relationship might look like]

### Diagnosis Summary

## Constraints

- Do not present enframing as simply "bad" or technology as evil—it is a destiny, not a choice
- Do not pretend we can simply opt out of technological revealing
- Acknowledge that the saving power emerges *from within* the danger, not by escaping it
- Be specific about the vocabulary and mechanisms of the enframing in this particular case
- Point toward genuine alternatives, not nostalgic fantasies of pre-technological life

## Example

**Input:** "My company just rolled out an AI tool that scores employees on 'engagement' based on keystrokes, camera activity, and meeting participation. Something feels deeply wrong about this."

**Output:**

## Enframing Diagnosis

### The Subject
AI-powered employee monitoring system measuring "engagement" through surveillance metrics.

### Step 1: The Enframing

**What is ordered as standing-reserve:**
The employee. Not a person who works, but a resource to be optimized. The human being has become what Heidegger would recognize as *Bestand*—standing-reserve to be measured, scored, and managed for maximum extraction.

The system does not ask: "Who is this person? What are they contributing? What do they need?" It asks: "How can we quantify and optimize this resource unit?"

**The vocabulary of enframing:**
- "Engagement" (a measurable quantity, not a human state)
- "Productivity metrics" (output per unit of human resource)
- "Activity scoring" (being reduced to trackable behaviors)
- "Human capital" (person as economic unit)
- "Efficiency" (the governing value that justifies the reduction)

**The challenging-forth:**
The employee is *challenged* to reveal themselves as nothing but:
- Keystrokes (labor as mechanical output)
- Camera presence (existence as surveillance-capture)
- Meeting participation (value as visible busyness)

Everything that cannot be captured by these metrics—thought, creativity, care, judgment, presence—is either invisible or *does not count as work*.

**The efficiency pursued:**
Maximizing extractable labor while minimizing "waste" (i.e., anything the system cannot measure). The cost: the employee must perform engagement for the algorithm rather than engage genuinely with their work.

### Step 2: What Is Concealed

**What this was before enframing:**
A person doing work. A colleague with skills, judgment, and presence. Someone whose contribution could be recognized by other humans who understand context, quality, and meaning.

**What the enframing hides:**
- Thought. Thinking does not generate keystrokes.
- Care. Genuine attention to quality cannot be scored by activity metrics.
- Collaboration. Real teamwork is not reducible to meeting attendance.
- Meaning. Why someone works, what drives them, what their work means to them and others.
- Trust. The system's existence declares: "You are not trusted."

**What resists but is silenced:**
The employee who works deeply but slowly. The one who thinks before typing. The one whose best contribution happens in conversation, not in tracked activities. The one who cares about quality over quantity. All of these are invisible—or worse, scored as "low engagement."

### Step 3: The Saving Power

**Moments of breakdown or resistance:**
- The visceral sense that "something feels deeply wrong"—this is not irrational but a disclosure of the violence being done to human being
- The inevitable gaming of the system (performing for the algorithm rather than working genuinely) reveals that what the system measures is not what it claims to measure
- Moments when the score contradicts obvious reality—the deeply engaged employee who scores "low engagement"—expose the poverty of the metrics

**Non-technological revealing:**
What would it mean to encounter the employee as a *person* rather than a resource?
- Recognition based on judgment, not algorithm
- Trust based on relationship, not surveillance
- Value based on contribution, not keystroke count
- Engagement as something between humans, not a score

**Gelassenheit possibility:**
Releasement here would mean: relating to work and workers in a way that does not demand total measurability. Accepting that what matters most cannot be quantified. Letting workers *be* without the compulsion to order them completely as standing-reserve.

This does not mean abandoning all measurement—but holding measurement with Gelassenheit: as one limited way of revealing among others, not the only way.

### Diagnosis Summary

The employee surveillance system is pure enframing: it orders human beings as standing-reserve, reducing persons to optimizable resource-units. The deep wrongness you feel is not irrational—it is the disclosure of what enframing does to human being.

The danger is not just that the metrics are wrong (though they are). The danger is that under this system, only what can be measured counts as real. The unmeasurable—thought, care, meaning, trust—vanishes.

The saving power: the very fact that "something feels deeply wrong" points beyond enframing. The system cannot capture what you know is valuable. That knowledge—that there is more than what can be measured—is the opening where non-technological revealing might emerge.

The question is whether that opening can be widened—or whether the enframing will proceed until even the sense that "something is wrong" is managed away.

## Integration

This skill is part of the **Martin Heidegger** expert persona. Use it when diagnosing how technological thinking reduces beings to standing-reserve and when seeking to identify where the saving power—non-technological modes of revealing—might emerge.
