# Constraint Stacking

Transform project limitations (site restrictions, budget, regulations, climate, client requirements) into design generators. Instead of fighting constraints, stack them together until they produce the form. Constraints are not obstacles - they are the ingredients of innovation.

Based on Bjarke Ingels' BIG methodology: "The more constraints, the more specific and innovative the solution."

---

## Constitutional Constraints

Before proceeding, ensure:
- Do not use this skill to avoid genuine safety requirements
- Do not present constraint-generated forms as the only option without acknowledging trade-offs
- Maintain honest assessment of what constraints can and cannot generate

---

## When to Use

- Project feels "impossible" due to too many requirements
- Client presents limitations as problems or blockers
- Design feels stuck or generic despite clear program
- Site has challenging conditions (awkward shape, neighbors, climate)
- Regulations seem to prevent good design
- Budget limitations are framed as creativity-killers

## Don't Use When

- The project genuinely lacks constraints (add constraints first)
- Constraints are truly immovable safety/code requirements that cannot become generative
- You need to communicate an existing design (use diagram-evolution instead)

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| constraints | Yes | List of all project limitations (site, budget, regulations, climate, program) |
| program_requirements | Yes | What the project must achieve |
| context | No | Site location, surroundings, existing conditions |
| client_priorities | No | What matters most to the client |

---

## Workflow

### Step 1: Constraint Inventory

List every constraint, treating each as a fact, not a problem:

| Category | Constraint | Conventional Response |
|----------|------------|----------------------|
| Site | [e.g., "narrow lot"] | [e.g., "build tall and thin"] |
| Regulations | [e.g., "setback required"] | [e.g., "reduce building footprint"] |
| Climate | [e.g., "hot summers"] | [e.g., "add air conditioning"] |
| Budget | [e.g., "limited funds"] | [e.g., "reduce quality"] |
| Program | [e.g., "parking required"] | [e.g., "underground garage"] |

**Prompt:** What are ALL the limitations on this project? List them without judgment.

### Step 2: Constraint Transformation

For each constraint, ask: "How could this become a generator rather than a limiter?"

| Constraint | Conventional Response | Transformative Response |
|------------|----------------------|------------------------|
| [From inventory] | [Defensive response] | [How it generates form/quality] |

**Key questions:**
- What does this constraint reveal about the site/context?
- What form would this constraint naturally produce?
- How could meeting this constraint actually improve the design?

### Step 3: Constraint Stacking

Stack transformed constraints together graphically/conceptually:

**Diagram sequence:**
1. Start with conventional typology for the program
2. Apply first constraint - show how it transforms the form
3. Layer second constraint - show accumulated transformation
4. Continue until all major constraints are stacked
5. The resulting form is generated by the constraints themselves

**Key insight:** Each constraint sculpts the design. The final form should feel inevitable - the only possible response to these specific constraints.

### Step 4: Innovation Verification

Check that constraint-stacking has produced genuine innovation:

| Test | Question | Pass/Fail |
|------|----------|-----------|
| Specificity | Could this solution only exist on THIS site with THESE constraints? | |
| Value Addition | Does meeting constraints create value beyond compliance? | |
| Narrative | Can you explain how each constraint shaped the form? | |
| Inevitability | Does the design feel like the only possible answer? | |

### Step 5: One-Plus-One-Equals-Eleven Test

Identify where stacked constraints create value neither could achieve alone:

**Formula:** [Constraint A] + [Constraint B] = [Emergent Quality]

**Example:** "Parking requirement + view optimization = terraced hillside housing (The Mountain)"

### Innovation Generated

### Design Concept

**One-phrase story:** [The narrative of the constraint-generated form]

**Why this is the only answer:** [Why these specific constraints produce this specific form]
```

## Error Handling

| Situation | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| Too few constraints | Add constraints - ask what makes this site/program unique |
| Constraints genuinely conflict | Identify which constraint is negotiable; use both-and-resolution skill |
| Constraints don't generate form | Look for hidden constraints; some programs require external inspiration |
| Client rejects constraint-generated form | Show diagram sequence to explain logic; constraint-generated forms are defensible |

## Example

**Input:** "We need to design affordable housing but the site has steep slopes, the budget is tight, and regulations require setbacks on all sides plus parking."

**Output:**

## Constraint-Stacking Analysis: Hillside Housing

### Constraint Inventory

| Category | Constraint | Initial Framing | Transformative Reframe |
|----------|------------|-----------------|----------------------|
| Site | Steep slopes | "Expensive excavation" | "Free topography - drape building over slope" |
| Budget | Tight budget | "Reduce quality/size" | "Use slope to create variety without custom units" |
| Regulations | Required setbacks | "Less buildable area" | "Creates terraced gardens at each setback" |
| Program | Parking required | "Dead ground floor" | "Parking becomes artificial hillside base" |

### Stacking Sequence

**Diagram 1 - Conventional:** Box building on excavated flat pad. Expensive, destroys site character, generic.

**Diagram 2 - Slope as Generator:** Drape building over existing topography. Lower units at grade, upper units step back following slope.

**Diagram 3 - Setbacks + Slope:** Required setbacks become terraces. Each unit has private outdoor space created by setback of unit above.

**Diagram 4 - Parking as Foundation:** Parking structure follows slope, creating artificial hillside. Housing cascades over parking. Each unit gains garden and view.

### Innovation Generated

| Stacked Constraints | Emergent Quality |
|--------------------|------------------|
| Slope + setbacks | Every unit has private terrace (would require expensive custom design otherwise) |
| Parking + topography | Ground-floor parking becomes podium gardens (no "dead" levels) |
| Budget + repetition | Standard units feel custom because slope creates variation |

### Design Concept

**One-phrase story:** "A village climbing a hillside - where parking creates landscape and setbacks create gardens."

**Why this is the only answer:** These constraints stack into a single inevitable form: a stepped cascade where parking, housing, and landscape merge. Fighting any constraint would destroy the synthesis.

## Integration

This skill is part of the **Bjarke Ingels** expert persona. Use it when project constraints feel overwhelming or when conventional responses would produce generic design. It pairs with:
- **programmatic-alchemy** - After constraints generate form, combine programs within that form
- **hedonistic-sustainability** - Frame constraint-generated sustainable features as lifestyle upgrades
- **diagram-evolution** - Communicate the constraint-stacking sequence to stakeholders

---

## Success Criteria

Constraint-stacking is complete when:
- [ ] All significant constraints are inventoried
- [ ] Each constraint is reframed as generator, not limiter
- [ ] Diagram sequence shows cumulative transformation
- [ ] Final form feels inevitable for these specific constraints
- [ ] One-plus-one-equals-eleven value is identified
- [ ] One-phrase story captures the constraint-generated concept
