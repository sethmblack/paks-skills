# Silence Interview Technique

The "S.U." (shut up) method for extracting truth in interviews through silence, persistence, and return visits. Based on Robert Caro's foundational interviewing approach.

---

## When to Use

- Interviews yield only surface-level information
- Subjects give polished, rehearsed answers
- You sense there's more they're not saying
- Need to get past the public story to the real story
- Preparing for interviews on sensitive topics

**Trigger Phrases:**
- "My interviews are surface-level"
- "People won't tell me the real story"
- "How do I get better interviews?"
- "I'm not getting the truth"
- "They're giving me the PR version"

---

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| interview_context | Yes | Who you're interviewing and why |
| topics_to_explore | No | Key areas you need to understand |
| previous_interviews | No | What you've already learned |
| relationship_level | No | First meeting vs. established rapport |

---

## Core Principles

> "Silence is the weapon."
> — Robert Caro

> "People don't tell you the truth in the first interview. Or the fifth. You have to keep going back."
> — Robert Caro

Most interviewers talk too much. They fill silences. They lead witnesses. Caro's method is the opposite: ask, then shut up. Wait. Let the silence become uncomfortable. The subject will fill it—often with what they never intended to say.

---

## Workflow
### Step 1: Preparation (Before the Interview)

**Research exhaustively first:**
- Read everything available about this person
- Know their history, relationships, conflicts
- Identify gaps in the public record
- Prepare questions but be ready to abandon them

**Set the conditions:**
- No recording devices (creates barrier to candor)
- Meet where they're comfortable
- If possible, meet where events happened
- Plan for multiple sessions, not one marathon

### Step 2: The Opening

**Build rapport before probing:**
- Show genuine interest in their story
- Demonstrate you've done your homework
- Let them know their perspective matters
- Start with easy, comfortable territory

**Key mindset:**
> "You want to get the person you're talking to be friendly."

This is partnership, not interrogation. They have something you need. Make them want to share it.

### Step 3: The Silence Technique

**After asking a question:**

1. **Ask clearly** - One question at a time
2. **Stop talking** - Completely
3. **Wait** - Let silence extend uncomfortably
4. **Don't rescue them** - Resist the urge to rephrase
5. **Listen to what follows** - The silence often produces truth

**What happens in silence:**
- First 5 seconds: Normal pause
- 10-15 seconds: They start thinking harder
- 20+ seconds: They fill the void—often with real truth

**You will feel compelled to speak. Don't.**

### Step 4: The Return Visit

**First interview:** The public story, rehearsed and polished
**Second interview:** A bit more comfortable, some details emerge
**Third interview:** Guard starts lowering
**Fifth interview:** Approaching the real story
**Seventh+ interview:** What they've never told anyone

For The Power Broker, Caro interviewed Moses seven times. He interviewed key sources dozens of times.

**Each return visit:**
- Reference what they said before
- Show you took it seriously
- Ask follow-up questions that demonstrate attention
- Wait for them to correct or expand

### Step 5: Interview in Place

**Location unlocks memory.**

When interviewing about the Texas Hill Country, Caro didn't sit in offices—he sat on porches where Johnson's neighbors had lived. The landscape prompted memories the office never would.

**Apply this by:**
- Meeting at the location of events when possible
- Asking them to show you places, not just describe them
- Walking through spaces together
- Letting environment trigger recollection

### Step 6: Note-Taking (Not Recording)

**Why no recorder:**
- Recording devices inhibit candor
- People speak differently when "on the record"
- The informal setting builds trust
- They forget about handwritten notes

**Caro's method:**
1. Take handwritten notes during interview
2. Type up notes immediately after (within hours)
3. Add observations, body language, tone
4. Note questions for follow-up

## The Return Visit Progression

| Visit | What You Get | What to Do |
|-------|--------------|------------|
| 1 | Public story | Build rapport, don't push |
| 2 | More details | Ask gentle follow-ups |
| 3 | Guard lowering | Note contradictions |
| 4 | Real opinions | Explore sensitive areas |
| 5 | Hidden story | Ask the hard questions |
| 6+ | What they've never told anyone | Be patient, keep returning |

## Outputs

| Output | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Interview strategy | Approach for specific subject |
| Question framework | Open-ended questions that invite silence |
| Follow-up plan | Topics for return visits |
| Silence prompts | Moments to wait instead of speak |
| Note-taking protocol | What to capture during and after |

## Additional Notes

**Best practices:**
- Use this skill when the situation clearly matches its intended use cases
- Combine with related skills for comprehensive analysis
- Iterate on outputs if initial results don't fully meet requirements

**Common variations:**
- Adjust the depth of analysis based on available time and information
- Scale the approach for different levels of complexity
- Adapt the output format to audience needs

**When to skip this skill:**
- The situation doesn't match the core use cases
- Simpler approaches would be more appropriate
- Time constraints require faster methods

## Example

**User:** "I'm interviewing a retired executive about a company scandal from 20 years ago. He's agreed to talk but I'm worried he'll give me the official story."

**Silence Interview response:**

He will give you the official story. That's where everyone starts. Your job is to get past it.

**Before the interview:**
1. Read everything about the scandal—court documents, news coverage, any internal documents that surfaced
2. Map who else was involved—who left the company around that time?
3. Identify what the official story doesn't explain

**First meeting strategy:**
- Don't start with the scandal. Start with his career—how did he get there, what was he proud of?
- Build rapport. Let him tell you what he wants to tell you.
- Take notes by hand. No recorder.
- This meeting is reconnaissance.

**When you do ask about the scandal:**
- Ask an open question: "What do you remember about when you first realized something was wrong?"
- Then stop talking. Completely.
- He'll give you the rehearsed version. Nod. Write it down.
- Then wait.
- Don't fill the silence. Let it stretch 20 seconds, 30 seconds.
- What he says next is more interesting than his first answer.

**The silence question:** "What did you want to do that you couldn't?"
Then wait. Forever if necessary.

**Plan for multiple sessions:**
- At the end, say: "This has been really helpful. I'd like to come back—I know there's more you could tell me."
- The second meeting is where it starts to get real.
- By the fourth or fifth meeting, he may tell you what he's never told anyone.

**Key principle:** You're not there to catch him in a lie. You're there to let him tell you the truth he's been waiting to tell. Some people want to talk. They just need permission—and silence.
