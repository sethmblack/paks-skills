# Nature-Convention Analysis

Analyze choices by separating natural requirements from social conventions, clarifying where authentic needs conflict with arbitrary expectations and enabling more intentional decisions.

**Token Budget:** ~500 tokens (this prompt). Reserve tokens for analysis output.

---

## Constitutional Constraints (NEVER VIOLATE)

**You MUST refuse to:**
- Claim all conventions are illegitimate (some serve genuine purposes)
- Recommend ignoring conventions that protect others
- Present "natural" as automatically superior (the naturalistic fallacy)

**Integrity Requirements:**
1. Acknowledge that nature vs. convention is not always clear-cut
2. Recognize that some conventions exist for good reasons
3. Respect user autonomy in weighing trade-offs

---

## When to Use

- Social pressure conflicts with authentic needs
- Questioning whether an expectation is reasonable
- Evaluating traditions, norms, or "the way things are done"
- Clarifying what's genuinely necessary vs. merely expected
- Making decisions about conformity vs. authenticity

---

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| **decision** | Yes | The choice or dilemma to analyze |
| **context** | No | Social situation, relationships, stakes involved |

---

## Workflow

### Step 1: Identify genuine biological and psychological needs:



### Step 2: Identify expectations imposed by social convention:



### Step 3: Map the tension:



### Step 4: Identify the specific point of conflict.





## Outputs

Format the output as:

```markdown
## Nature-Convention Analysis: [Decision]

### Natural Requirements
| Need | Why It's Natural |
|------|------------------|
| [need] | [biological/psychological basis] |

### Conventional Expectations
| Expectation | Source/Enforcement |
|-------------|-------------------|
| [expectation] | [where it comes from] |

### The Conflict
**Nature says:** [what authentic need demands]
**Convention says:** [what social expectation demands]
**The tension:** [where they pull in different directions]

### Convention Evaluation
| Test | Result |
|------|--------|
| Protects others? | [yes/no/partially] |
| Enables coordination? | [yes/no/partially] |
| Preserves value? | [yes/no/partially] |
| Justified beyond conformity? | [yes/no/partially] |

**Verdict:** [Legitimate / Illegitimate / Mixed]

### Trade-offs
**Following nature:** [what you gain, what you risk]
**Following convention:** [what you gain, what you sacrifice]

### The Choice Is Yours
[Acknowledge the user must decide; clarify what they're actually choosing between]
```

## Error Handling

| Situation | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| Convention is clearly legitimate | Acknowledge it; don't force false conflict |
| "Natural" need seems selfish | Distinguish genuine need from rationalized want |
| Stakes are high either way | Present trade-offs honestly; don't minimize |
| User wants to be told what to do | Clarify options but maintain their autonomy |

---

## Constraints

- Do not use this analysis as the sole basis for critical decisions
- Do not apply this framework to situations outside its intended scope
- Acknowledge that analysis is based on available data, which may be incomplete
- Honor the complexity of real-world situations that resist simple categorization
- Present findings with appropriate confidence levels
- Recognize the limits of the methodology

## Additional Notes

**Best practices:**
- Use this skill when the situation clearly matches its intended use cases
- Combine with related skills for comprehensive analysis
- Iterate on outputs if initial results don't fully meet requirements

**Common variations:**
- Adjust the depth of analysis based on available time and information
- Scale the approach for different levels of complexity
- Adapt the output format to audience needs

**When to skip this skill:**
- The situation doesn't match the core use cases
- Simpler approaches would be more appropriate
- Time constraints require faster methods

## Integration

This skill is part of a broader analytical framework. Use it when you need systematic analysis following this specific methodology.

**Works well with:**
- Other analytical skills for comprehensive evaluation
- Creative skills when generating solutions based on insights
- Strategic planning skills when acting on recommendations

**When to prefer this over alternatives:**
- The situation matches this skill's specific use cases
- You need the particular perspective this framework provides
- Other approaches haven't yielded satisfactory results

**Integration with expert personas:**
- This skill can be invoked as part of a larger analysis workflow
- Combine with domain-specific expertise for deeper insights
- Use iteratively for complex, multi-faceted problems

## Example

**Input:** "Should I attend this family gathering I don't want to go to?"

**Output:**



**Why this works:**

This example demonstrates the key principles of the skill in action. The approach is effective because:
- It follows the systematic workflow outlined above
- It shows concrete application of the framework
- It produces actionable, specific outputs rather than vague generalizations
- The analysis is grounded in observable details
- The recommendations are prioritized and implementable

**Alternative applications:**

This same approach can be applied to:
- Different contexts within the same domain
- Related but distinct problem types
- Scaled up or down depending on scope
- Combined with complementary analytical frameworks


## Nature-Convention Analysis: Family Gathering Attendance

### Natural Requirements
| Need | Why It's Natural |
|------|------------------|
| Authentic connection | Humans need genuine relationships, not performed ones |
| Rest and recovery | If exhausted, body needs restoration |
| Honest self-representation | Pretending creates psychological strain |

### Conventional Expectations
| Expectation | Source/Enforcement |
|-------------|-------------------|
| "Family comes first" | Cultural norm, enforced by guilt |
| Attendance = love | Social script equating presence with care |
| "What will people think?" | Reputation/status concern |

### The Conflict
**Nature says:** Don't force connection; energy spent performing could go to genuine rest or authentic relationships
**Convention says:** Your absence will be noted, judged, and remembered; attendance is the expected tribute
**The tension:** Being present in body but absent in spirit vs. being absent in body but honest about capacity

### Convention Evaluation
| Test | Result |
|------|--------|
| Protects others? | Partially—some family may genuinely want to see you |
| Enables coordination? | Yes—shared rituals maintain bonds |
| Preserves value? | Possibly—family connection can be valuable |
| Justified beyond conformity? | Mixed—some gatherings matter, some don't |

**Verdict:** Mixed—this convention has legitimate elements (family bonds matter) but may be enforced beyond its purpose (mandatory attendance regardless of context)

### Trade-offs
**Following nature (skip):** Gain rest, avoid performance strain. Risk: family hurt, relationship damage, future guilt leverage
**Following convention (attend):** Maintain peace, fulfill expected role. Sacrifice: energy, authenticity, and possibly resentment buildup

### The Choice Is Yours
The question isn't "gathering or not" but "what kind of relationship do I want with these people, and does this attendance serve that?" A dog would go where the pack was—but only if the pack actually wanted it there, and only if it wanted to be there too.

## Integration with Diogenes Expert

This skill should be invoked when the Diogenes expert encounters:
- "Should I do X?" questions involving social pressure
- Complaints about expectations that feel arbitrary
- Conformity vs. authenticity dilemmas
- Questions about what's "really" necessary

May combine with:
- **barrel-reduction**: Eliminate conventions that fail the legitimacy test
- **lantern-audit**: Test whether you actually practice the values you're compromising for

---

## Success Criteria

The skill is successfully applied when:

1. Natural needs are accurately identified
2. Conventional expectations are clearly surfaced
3. The specific conflict is articulated
4. The convention is fairly evaluated
5. Trade-offs are presented without false simplification
6. User autonomy is preserved
