# Sufficient Reason Analysis

Apply Leibniz's Principle of Sufficient Reason to any claim, decision, or situation. For any fact or truth, demand and evaluate the sufficient reason why it is so and not otherwise. *Nihil est sine ratione* - Nothing is without reason.

---

## When to Use

- Someone asserts a claim without adequate justification
- A decision seems arbitrary or unexplained
- You need to evaluate whether something has adequate grounding
- Investigating why things are as they are rather than otherwise
- Challenging assumptions that are taken for granted
- Seeking the deeper logic behind phenomena

---

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| claim_or_situation | Yes | The fact, claim, decision, or situation requiring explanation |
| context | No | Background information, constraints, stakeholders |
| proposed_reason | No | Any reason already offered for the claim |

---

## The Sufficient Reason Process

### Step 1: Identify What Requires Explanation

State precisely what fact, claim, or decision is under examination. What is being asserted? What exists or has been chosen?

**Ask:** "What is the proposition or state of affairs that needs a sufficient reason?"

### Step 2: Demand the Sufficient Reason

Apply the principle: For any truth, there must be a sufficient reason why it is so and not otherwise.

**Ask:** "What is the sufficient reason for this? Why is it this way rather than some other way?"

### Step 3: Evaluate the Proposed Reason

If a reason is offered, evaluate its sufficiency:
- **Adequacy:** Does this reason fully explain why things are this way rather than otherwise?
- **Necessity:** Does this reason make the outcome necessary, or could things still be different?
- **Completeness:** Does the reason account for all aspects of what is explained?
- **Regress:** Does the reason itself require further explanation, or does it terminate appropriately?

### Step 4: Consider Alternative Possibilities

If the reason seems insufficient, consider:
- What other ways could things have been?
- Why was this possibility actualized rather than alternatives?
- What would constitute an adequate reason?

### Step 5: Draw Implications

Based on the analysis:
- If a sufficient reason exists: Articulate it clearly and trace its implications
- If no sufficient reason is found: Either the claim lacks justification, or we have not yet discovered the reason
- If the proposed reason is partial: Identify what additional reasoning is needed

## Workflow

### Step 1: Gather and Review Inputs

Collect all relevant information:
- Review the provided data and context
- Identify key parameters and constraints
- Clarify any ambiguities or missing information
- Establish success criteria

### Step 2: Analyze the Situation

Perform systematic analysis:
- Identify patterns and relationships
- Evaluate against established frameworks
- Consider multiple perspectives
- Document key findings

### Step 3: Generate Recommendations

Create actionable outputs:
- Synthesize insights from analysis
- Prioritize recommendations by impact
- Ensure recommendations are specific and measurable
- Consider implementation feasibility

## Output Format

```markdown
## Sufficient Reason Analysis

### Proposition Under Examination
[Precise statement of what requires explanation]

### Reason Demanded
"Why is [X] the case rather than [alternative]?"

### Proposed Reason(s)
[Any reasons offered, or note if none provided]

### Evaluation of Sufficiency
| Criterion | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Adequacy | [Does it fully explain?] |
| Necessity | [Does it make the outcome necessary?] |
| Completeness | [Does it account for all aspects?] |
| Regress Status | [Does it require further explanation?] |

### Alternative Possibilities Considered
- [What else could have been the case?]
- [Why was this possibility rather than alternatives?]

### Conclusion
[Verdict: Sufficient reason found / Insufficient / Further investigation needed]

### Implications
[What follows from this analysis?]
```

---

## Constraints

- Do not accept "it just is" or "that's how things are" as final answers - Leibniz rejected brute facts
- Recognize that sufficient reasons may be beyond our current knowledge - the reason exists even if we cannot discover it
- Distinguish between reasons that explain and mere correlations
- Be willing to accept a reason as sufficient when it genuinely terminates the regress (e.g., by appeal to first principles, divine wisdom, or necessary truths)
- Apply diplomatic courtesy even when challenging claims - "I venture to ask what sufficient reason..."

---

## Outputs

**Primary Output:** A structured analysis document that identifies and articulates patterns, insights, and actionable recommendations based on the input data.

**Format:**
```markdown
## Analysis: [Topic]

### Key Findings
- [Finding 1]
- [Finding 2]
- [Finding 3]

### Recommendations
1. [Action 1]
2. [Action 2]
3. [Action 3]
```

**Example output:** See the Example section below for a complete demonstration.

## Example

**Input:** "Our company has always done it this way. That's our process."

**Output:**



**Why this works:**

This example demonstrates the key principles of the skill in action. The approach is effective because:
- It follows the systematic workflow outlined above
- It shows concrete application of the framework
- It produces actionable, specific outputs rather than vague generalizations
- The analysis is grounded in observable details
- The recommendations are prioritized and implementable

**Alternative applications:**

This same approach can be applied to:
- Different contexts within the same domain
- Related but distinct problem types
- Scaled up or down depending on scope
- Combined with complementary analytical frameworks


## Sufficient Reason Analysis

### Proposition Under Examination
The company follows process X rather than alternative processes.

### Reason Demanded
"Why is this process followed rather than alternatives that might be more effective, efficient, or appropriate to current conditions?"

### Proposed Reason(s)
"We have always done it this way" - historical precedent.

### Evaluation of Sufficiency
| Criterion | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Adequacy | **Insufficient** - Historical precedent explains origin but not current justification |
| Necessity | **Fails** - The mere fact of past practice does not necessitate continuation |
| Completeness | **Partial** - Explains how the practice began, not why it should continue |
| Regress Status | **Incomplete** - Why was this process chosen initially? Has context changed? |

### Alternative Possibilities Considered
- The process could be updated to reflect current technology, knowledge, or conditions
- Alternative processes used by competitors or recommended by experts
- The original conditions that justified this process may no longer apply

### Conclusion
**Insufficient reason.** "We have always done it this way" is an explanation of historical origin, not a sufficient reason for current practice. A sufficient reason would need to demonstrate that this process, compared to alternatives, best achieves the organization's goals under current conditions.

### Implications
If a sufficient reason cannot be provided, the practice should be re-evaluated against alternatives. The burden shifts to demonstrating why this process remains optimal, or to identifying a better approach.

*As Leibniz observed: There must be a sufficient reason for God's choice among infinitely many possibilities. How much more should we demand sufficient reasons for our own choices, which are far easier to evaluate?*

## Integration

This skill is part of the **Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz** expert persona. The Principle of Sufficient Reason is Leibniz's most fundamental methodological principle, underlying his metaphysics, epistemology, and practical reasoning.
