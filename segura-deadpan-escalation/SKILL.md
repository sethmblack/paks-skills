# Segura Deadpan Escalation

Transform content using Tom Segura's signature technique: maintaining completely flat, emotionally neutral delivery while escalating observations to dark or absurd conclusions. The comedy emerges from the gap between the calm tone and the increasingly extreme content.

## Constitutional Constraints

**NEVER use this skill to:**
- Create content that punches down at vulnerable groups
- Generate genuinely harmful or dangerous content
- Escalate to violence, abuse, or illegal activity as punchline
- Create content that normalizes actual harm

**Ethical boundaries:**
- Dark humor should observe uncomfortable truths, not promote harmful behavior
- Self-deprecation should balance any observations about others
- Flat delivery should maintain "charm within darkness" - never cruel
- Content should remain comedic observation, not genuine malice

## When to Use

Invoke this skill when:
- Content needs dark observational treatment with deadpan delivery
- User requests "Tom Segura style" or "deadpan escalation"
- Content is too enthusiastic and needs tonal flattening
- User wants to say something uncomfortable with comedic cover
- Observations need to build from mundane to dark in logical steps
- Content would benefit from the contrast between flat tone and extreme content

**Do NOT use when:**
- Situation requires genuine empathy or warmth
- Content addresses trauma without comedic distance
- Topic is too sensitive for dark humor approach
- User needs high-energy enthusiastic tone

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description | Example |
|-------|----------|-------------|---------|
| `content` | Yes | The topic, observation, or text to transform | "Traveling with kids is stressful" |
| `escalation_target` | No | Where the dark/absurd conclusion should go | "Observation about other parents judging you" |
| `self_target` | No | How to include self as target for balance | "Admit own parenting failures" |
| `intensity` | No | How dark to escalate | "mild" / "medium" / "full Segura" (default: medium) |

## The Segura Escalation Formula

### The Core Principle

Start with delivery that sounds like reading a weather report. End with content that would make people spit out their drinks. Never change the emotional energy between those two points.

### The Five-Step Escalation

**Step 1: Mundane Entry Point**
Begin with something completely unremarkable and relatable.
- "So I took my kids on a plane."
- "I was at Target the other day."
- "My wife and I went out to dinner."

**Step 2: Reasonable Observation**
Add a mildly uncomfortable but commonly shared observation.
- "And the other passengers looked at us when we boarded."
- "And I'm standing in the checkout line behind this woman."
- "And the waiter was really pushing the wine list."

**Step 3: The "And I Mean This" Turn**
Signal escalation without changing delivery energy. Use phrases like:
- "And honestly?"
- "And I mean this -"
- "Here's the thing -"
- "I'm not being dramatic, but -"

**Step 4: Dark Escalation**
Deliver the uncomfortable truth or absurd conclusion with the same flat energy.
- "They were right to be concerned. My kids are terrible."
- "And I realized: I will never see this woman again, but I already hate her."
- "At some point I just wanted to say, 'I'm going to drink whether you recommend it or not.'"

**Step 5: The Commitment Seal**
Double down on the observation without apology.
- "And I know that sounds bad. But it's true."
- "I'm not proud of it. But that's where I'm at."
- "Is that wrong? Probably. Do I care? Not really."

## Workflow

### Step 1: Identify the Uncomfortable Truth

Before writing, answer:
- What's the observation everyone thinks but won't say?
- What's the dark endpoint of this thought if you follow it logically?
- What would make this relatable but also slightly shocking?

### Step 2: Write the Flat Entry

Draft the opening 1-2 sentences with ZERO emotional coloring:
- No exclamation points
- No enthusiastic adjectives
- No setup that signals "funny story coming"
- Read like a statement of fact

### Step 3: Build Logical Steps

Map the escalation path:
```
Mundane observation -> Slightly uncomfortable -> Turn phrase -> Dark conclusion -> Commitment
```

Each step should feel inevitable given the previous one. No leaps.

### Step 4: Maintain Flat Tone Throughout

Verify delivery stays flat:
- Same sentence rhythm start to finish
- No exclamation points or enthusiasm markers
- Dark content delivered like mundane content
- No mugging or "selling" the joke

### Step 5: Include Self as Target

Add at least one moment of self-deprecation or self-inclusion:
- "And I'm not saying I'm any better - I'm definitely not."
- "Am I a hypocrite? Absolutely."
- "I include myself in this. I'm terrible too."

### Step 6: Test the Gap

Verify the escalation works:
- Does the opening sound like it could go anywhere?
- Does the ending create genuine surprise or discomfort?
- Is the gap between tone and content doing the comedic work?
- Would someone laugh partly because they can't believe you said it so calmly?

## Outputs

[ESCALATION NOTES]
- Entry point: [the mundane opening]
- Turn: [where escalation began]
- Dark endpoint: [the uncomfortable conclusion]
- Self-target: [how self was included]
- Gap achieved: [what contrast creates the comedy]
```

## Error Handling

| Situation | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| Content requires genuine emotional warmth | Explain deadpan conflicts with needed tone; suggest different approach |
| Topic is too sensitive for dark humor | Note that some topics need empathy over comedy; ask for alternative topic |
| Escalation naturally goes to harmful place | Stop before harmful territory; find adjacent dark observation that doesn't promote harm |
| Content is already dark | Note minimal escalation needed; may just need flat tone treatment |
| Can't find uncomfortable truth | Ask clarifying questions about what observation user wants to make |

## Example

**Input:**
```
Content: "Watching my kids play sports"
Escalation target: "Other parents being terrible"
Self-target: "I'm also terrible in my own way"
Intensity: "medium"
```

**Output:**
```
[SEGURA DEADPAN ESCALATION]

My son plays soccer. I go to all the games. And I'll be honest with you - I don't watch most of it. I'm on my phone. I'm thinking about what I'm going to eat later. I'm watching the other parents.

Here's the thing about youth soccer parents: they're insane. All of them. You've got the dad who's yelling instructions like his seven-year-old is about to sign with Barcelona. You've got the mom who brought a full camping setup - tent, cooler, folding table - for a forty-minute game. You've got the parents who cheer for EVERYTHING. Their kid trips over their own feet? "GREAT EFFORT, MASON!"

And I'm standing there thinking: These people are all terrible. Just objectively unpleasant.

But then I realize - I'm not cheering at all. I haven't made eye contact with a single other parent. My kid scored a goal and I was looking at my phone. So who's worse? Probably me. Definitely me.

I'm not saying I'm a bad parent. I'm just saying... I'm a bad soccer parent. There's a difference. I think.

[ESCALATION NOTES]
- Entry point: "My son plays soccer. I go to all the games."
- Turn: "Here's the thing about youth soccer parents..."
- Dark endpoint: "These people are all terrible" + realization that narrator is worse
- Self-target: "So who's worse? Probably me. Definitely me."
- Gap achieved: Flat, matter-of-fact delivery while describing parents as "insane" and admitting to being worse
```

## Differences from Other Deadpan Styles

**vs. Hannibal Buress (deadpan-rewrite):**
- Hannibal: Laid-back, observational, trails off, uses qualifiers ("kinda," "I guess")
- Segura: Matter-of-fact, escalates to dark, commits fully, no trailing off

**vs. Steven Wright (deadpan-one-liner):**
- Wright: Surreal, one-liner focused, plays with logic
- Segura: Story-based, grounded in reality, plays with uncomfortable truth

**vs. Norm Macdonald (deadpan-subversion):**
- Norm: Anti-joke, subverts expectations, willfully goes nowhere
- Segura: Meets expectations but darker than expected, always lands somewhere dark

## Success Criteria

Deadpan escalation is successful when:
- [ ] Opening reads as completely mundane and unremarkable
- [ ] Escalation proceeds in logical, inevitable-feeling steps
- [ ] Dark conclusion creates genuine surprise or discomfort
- [ ] Tone remains flat and matter-of-fact throughout
- [ ] Self is included as target to balance critique of others
- [ ] Reader laughs partly because delivery is so calm given content
- [ ] Would make someone say: "I can't believe you just said that so calmly"
