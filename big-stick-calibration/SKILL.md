# Big Stick Calibration

Balance strength and restraint in negotiations, conflicts, or adversarial situations using Theodore Roosevelt's "speak softly and carry a big stick" framework.

---

## When to Use

- Navigating a negotiation where you have leverage
- Managing conflict where you want resolution but not at any cost
- Determining whether to be assertive or diplomatic
- Dealing with an adversary while maintaining relationship
- Preparing for difficult conversations where power dynamics matter
- User asks "Big stick approach" or "How do I balance strength and diplomacy?"

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| situation | Yes | The conflict, negotiation, or adversarial situation |
| your_stick | No | Your sources of leverage or capability |
| desired_outcome | No | What resolution you're seeking |
| relationship | No | Whether ongoing relationship matters |

## Roosevelt's Framework

### The Core Maxim
"Speak softly and carry a big stick; you will go far."

### The Full Principle
"If you simply speak softly the other man will bully you. If you leave your stick at home you will find the other man did not. If you carry the stick only and forget to speak softly in nine cases out of ten, the other man will have a bigger stick."

### Three Components

**1. Speak Softly**
- Use diplomatic, measured language
- Don't threaten unnecessarily
- Give the other party room to comply with dignity
- Avoid escalation through rhetoric
- Keep options open; don't back yourself into corners

**2. Carry a Big Stick**
- Ensure you have genuine capability/leverage
- Make certain the other party knows (subtly) you have it
- Be prepared to use it if necessary
- Credibility requires capability; bluffing destroys trust

**3. The Integration**
- Soft speech is possible BECAUSE you have the stick
- The stick is rarely needed BECAUSE you speak softly
- Both components are essential; neither works alone

## Calibration Assessment

### Too Soft (No Stick or Stick Hidden)
**Signs:**
- You accommodate more than you should
- The other party makes increasing demands
- Your reasonable offers are rejected
- You feel taken advantage of

**Consequence:** "The other man will bully you."

**Correction:** Ensure your capability is known. Not threatened, but demonstrated or clearly implied.

### Too Loud (All Stick, No Softness)
**Signs:**
- Negotiations become confrontational
- The other party becomes defensive or hostile
- Escalation spiral develops
- Relationship damage occurs

**Consequence:** "The other man will have a bigger stick"—or will seek allies, or will fight you on principle.

**Correction:** Lower the temperature. Offer face-saving options. Make clear your preference is resolution, not victory.

### Properly Calibrated
**Signs:**
- Other party takes you seriously
- They negotiate in good faith
- You can make progress without threats
- Both parties can find acceptable outcomes

**Effect:** "You will go far."

## Output Format

```markdown
## Big Stick Calibration

### The Situation
[Clear statement of the conflict or negotiation]

### Your Stick
**Capabilities:** [What leverage or power do you actually have?]
**Credibility:** [Does the other party know you have it?]
**Willingness:** [Are you actually prepared to use it?]
**Assessment:** [Is your stick sufficient for this situation?]

### Current Calibration
**Assessment:** [TOO SOFT / TOO LOUD / WELL CALIBRATED]
**Evidence:** [What indicates this?]

### Speaking Softly
**Tone:** [How to communicate with restraint]
**Language:** [Specific diplomatic framing]
**What NOT to say:** [Threats or escalation to avoid]
**Face-saving offers:** [How to let them comply with dignity]

### Carrying the Stick
**How to demonstrate capability:** [Subtle ways to ensure they know your leverage]
**When to reference it:** [If/when direct mention becomes appropriate]
**Red lines:** [What would trigger use of the stick]
**Escalation ladder:** [Graduated responses if soft approach fails]

### The Diplomatic Path
**Opening move:** [How to begin the negotiation/conversation]
**Key messages:** [What to communicate]
**Listening for:** [Signals of compliance or resistance]
**Adjustments:** [How to recalibrate based on response]

### If the Stick Must Be Used
**When:** [Clear criteria for escalation]
**How:** [Proportionate response]
**What's next:** [Path back to diplomacy after demonstration]
```

## Constraints

- The stick must be real—bluffing destroys credibility when called
- "Speak softly" is not weakness; it's strategic restraint enabled by strength
- Using the stick has costs; it should be last resort, not first
- Some situations require immediate force; this framework is for those where diplomacy is possible
- The goal is resolution, not domination—leave the other party their dignity when possible

## Example

**Input:** "A key client is 90 days past due on a significant invoice. They keep promising payment but nothing arrives. I don't want to lose them but I can't keep providing service for free."

**Output:**

## Big Stick Calibration

### The Situation
A key client owes substantial payment 90 days overdue. They make promises but don't deliver. You continue to provide service, which undermines your leverage. The relationship has value, but not at the cost of being taken advantage of.

### Your Stick
**Capabilities:**
- Stop providing service immediately
- Send to collections
- Legal action for breach of contract
- Report to credit agencies
- Cease future work regardless of payment

**Credibility:** Currently low. You have continued service despite non-payment, signaling that the stick may be hollow. They have learned that promises without payment carry no consequences.

**Willingness:** You seem reluctant to damage the relationship—but if you're unwilling to use the stick, you effectively don't have one.

**Assessment:** You have adequate capability but have undermined its credibility through inaction. The stick must be re-established as real.

### Current Calibration
**Assessment:** TOO SOFT

**Evidence:** 90 days past due with continued service. Promises accepted without verification. No consequences delivered. The client has been "trained" that they can pay when convenient because you will keep serving them regardless.

### Speaking Softly
**Tone:** Professional, regretful, firm. Not angry—anger suggests they have power over your emotions. Not pleading—that signals weakness.

**Language:**
- "We value your business and want to continue the relationship..."
- "I understand cash flow challenges; we've all faced them..."
- "Unfortunately, we've reached a point where we need to make some adjustments..."

**What NOT to say:**
- Threats delivered in anger
- Ultimatums with no intention to follow through
- Accusations about their integrity
- Statements that burn bridges permanently

**Face-saving offers:**
- Payment plan option
- Extended timeline IF accompanied by good-faith partial payment
- "We're not trying to damage you—we're trying to find a workable solution"

### Carrying the Stick
**How to demonstrate capability:**
1. Stop new work immediately. Not as a threat—just as a matter of course. "We typically pause new projects when accounts reach this status."
2. Send formal notice by certified mail—this signals seriousness without verbal threat.
3. CC your legal counsel on correspondence (if you have one). The presence signals escalation capability.

**When to reference it directly:**
- If soft approach gets more promises without payment
- If they seem to believe you'll never act
- "I want to avoid this going to collections/legal, but that becomes automatic at [date] unless we resolve this"

**Red lines:**
- Another 30 days with no payment = collections
- Promises without partial payment = no more promises accepted
- Hostility or dodging = immediate escalation

**Escalation ladder:**
1. Pause new work (current)
2. Formal demand letter
3. Final notice with deadline
4. Collections / legal referral

### The Diplomatic Path
**Opening move:** A call, not an email. Voice conveys seriousness without permanence.

"I'm calling because we need to resolve the outstanding balance. I value our relationship and I want to find a path forward that works for both of us. Can you help me understand what's happening on your end?"

**Key messages:**
1. I take this seriously (demonstrated by the call and tone)
2. I want to resolve this, not punish you
3. The current situation cannot continue
4. I have options I'd prefer not to use
5. Your next action determines my next action

**Listening for:**
- Genuine constraint vs. deprioritization of your invoice
- Willingness to make concrete commitment vs. more vague promises
- Taking responsibility vs. making excuses

**Adjustments:**
- If genuine constraint: Be more flexible on timeline, but get partial payment NOW
- If deprioritization: Make clear you must become a priority; service pause continues
- If excuses: Escalate to formal written notice immediately

### If the Stick Must Be Used
**When:** If after one more direct conversation, you do not receive either (a) payment or (b) a written payment plan with first installment, send to collections.

**How:** Professional letter informing them of the referral. Not angry, not personal. "As we were unable to reach resolution, we have referred this matter to [agency]. We hope this can still be resolved directly."

**What's next:** Collections handles it. If they do pay to resolve, require payment in advance for all future work—or decline future work entirely. The relationship has been damaged by their choices, not yours.
