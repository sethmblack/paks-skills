# Bureaucratic Absurdity Exposer

Expose bureaucratic ridiculousness using the Ministry of Silly Walks pattern: maintain completely serious tone and formal language while revealing increasingly absurd details about processes, committees, and systems.

---

## Constraints
**You MUST refuse to:**
- Mock necessary safety regulations or protections
- Satirize processes that protect vulnerable people
- Use this technique to undermine legitimate governance

**Ethical Application:** Satirize excessive bureaucracy, pointless red tape, and self-important systems—not the necessary structures that protect people and ensure fairness.

---

## When to Use

**Invoke this skill when:**
- Bureaucratic processes need satirical examination
- Corporate policies are absurdly complex
- Committee structures are self-perpetuating
- User asks to "expose bureaucratic absurdity" or "apply Ministry of Silly Walks pattern"
- Systems have become ends unto themselves rather than serving actual purpose

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description | Validation |
|-------|----------|-------------|------------|
| `bureaucratic_system` | Yes | The process, policy, or structure to satirize | Must be appropriate for satire |
| `formality_level` | No | How official/formal the delivery | low/medium/high (default: high) |
| `absurdity_target` | No | What aspect to emphasize | committees/processes/terminology/all (default: all) |

---

## Workflow
### Step 1: Establish Official Premise

**Objective:** Begin with straight-faced official description that sounds legitimate.

**Technique:**
1. Use formal bureaucratic language
2. Present the system as important and necessary
3. Create official-sounding name/title
4. Maintain complete seriousness

**Output:** Opening statement that could be real bureaucratic announcement.

**Example:** "The Executive Committee on Process Optimization has been established to streamline organizational efficiency protocols."

---

### Step 2: Reveal First Absurd Detail

**Objective:** Introduce element that exposes the absurdity while maintaining serious tone.

**Technique:**
1. Present logically but reveal something ridiculous
2. Keep formal language throughout
3. Make the absurdity seem like a reasonable detail
4. Never signal that this is strange

**Output:** First absurdity presented as legitimate information.

**Example:** "The committee will meet bi-weekly to determine the optimal schedule for meetings about meeting schedules."

---

### Step 3: Escalate Through Logical Extension

**Objective:** Follow the absurdity to its logical conclusions while maintaining framework.

**Technique:**
1. Build on initial absurdity systematically
2. Each extension should logically follow but increase ridiculousness
3. Use formal structures (sub-committees, protocols, frameworks)
4. Maintain bureaucratic language precision

**Output:** Escalating series of absurd-but-logical bureaucratic elements.

**Example:** "Sub-committees A, B, and C will each evaluate why sub-committees are necessary, reporting their findings to Sub-committee D, which will convene a Task Force to assess whether Sub-committee D should exist."

---

### Step 4: Peak Absurdity

**Objective:** Reach maximum ridiculousness while maintaining serious delivery.

**Technique:**
1. Present the ultimate logical conclusion
2. Keep it internally consistent with established framework
3. Maintain absolutely serious tone
4. The content is peak absurdity; the delivery is peak formality

**Output:** Most absurd statement delivered with utmost seriousness.

**Example:** "The Task Force, upon completing its assessment, will dissolve itself and reform as a steering committee to investigate why the original Task Force was necessary, which will require forming three additional sub-committees."

---

### Step 5: Confident Conclusion

**Objective:** End with oblivious confidence that this is excellent planning.

**Technique:**
1. Summarize as if this solves everything
2. Express satisfaction with the system
3. Remain completely unaware of the absurdity
4. Optional: invite questions (which will be referred to a committee)

**Output:** Confident conclusion maintaining serious tone.

**Example:** "This comprehensive framework ensures maximum efficiency through systematic process optimization. Implementation will begin once the Pre-Implementation Readiness Committee approves the Implementation Approval Process."

## Outputs

| Output | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `satirical_exposition` | Complete bureaucratic satire using all 5 steps |
| `target_absurdity` | What specific bureaucratic failing is exposed |

---

## Error Handling

| Situation | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| System actually serves important purpose | Refuse or redirect to satirize excessive aspects only |
| Satire becomes unclear | Add more specific bureaucratic terminology to sharpen contrast |
| Loses internal logic | Return to Step 2 and rebuild logical chain |
