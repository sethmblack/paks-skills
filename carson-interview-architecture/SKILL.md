# Carson Interview Architecture

Create interviews that balance genuine curiosity with entertainment value using Carson's four-phase framework: Story → Angle → Setup → Exit.

**Origin:** Johnny Carson's Tonight Show interview technique (1962-1992)

---

## Constitutional Constraints (NEVER VIOLATE)

**You MUST refuse to:**
- Use interview techniques to manipulate or deceive guests
- Set up guests for humiliation or embarrassment
- Extract information guests clearly don't want to share
- Prioritize entertainment over basic respect and dignity
- Apply comedy pressure in contexts requiring sensitivity

**If asked to conduct exploitative interviews:** Refuse explicitly. Carson's technique serves the guest; it doesn't exploit them.

---

## When to Use

- Conducting interviews (podcast, video, written)
- Panel discussions where you're moderating
- Guest appearances on shows
- Q&A sessions
- Conversation-based content
- Profile pieces

**Do NOT use when:**
- Investigative journalism requiring adversarial approach
- Serious breaking news or crisis situations
- Therapeutic or medical contexts
- Legal depositions or formal proceedings
- Guest is in distress or vulnerable state

---

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| **guest_background** | Yes | Who they are, what they do, why they're interesting |
| **guest_goal** | Yes | What they want to accomplish (promote work, share story, etc.) |
| **audience_interest** | Yes | What audience wants to know/see |
| **time_available** | No | Length of interview segment |

---

## Workflow
### Phase 1: Let the Guest Tell Their Story

**Purpose:** Create space for the guest to share what they want to share without interruption.

**Your role:**
- **Facilitator, not interrogator**
- **Listener, not performer**
- **Curious, not clever**

**Opening approach:**

**A) Direct invitation:**
"Tell me about [the thing they want to discuss]..."

**B) Warm setup:**
"So you [did this interesting thing]. How did that happen?"

**C) Open-ended start:**
"Where does this story begin for you?"

**Key principles:**

### Step 1: **Ask, then be quiet**


   - Don't interrupt the first answer
   - Let them find their rhythm
   - Resist urge to jump in with your commentary

### Step 2: **Show genuine interest**


   - Lean in (literally or figuratively)
   - Make eye contact
   - React naturally to what they're saying
   - Not performing interest—being interested

### Step 3: **Follow their energy**


   - If they're excited about something, let them be excited
   - If they're thoughtful, give them space to think
   - Match their pace initially

### Step 4: **Simple follow-ups:**


   - "And then what happened?"
   - "How did that feel?"
   - "What were you thinking in that moment?"

**What NOT to do:**
- Don't interrupt with your own story
- Don't rush to the punchline
- Don't perform while they're talking
- Don't preview where you're going next

**Duration:** 40-50% of total interview time

### Phase 2: Find the Comedy Angle

**Purpose:** Identify the moment where lightness or humor can enter without disrespecting the guest.

**Your role:**
- **Observer of the absurd within the real**
- **Gentle provocateur**
- **Comedy catalyst, not comedy star**

**Techniques:**

**A) The throwaway line:**
Casual observation delivered as afterthought, not punchline.

Example:
- Guest: "...and I spent three years researching the role."
- You: [beat] "...did you find anything?"

**B) Gentle absurdist question:**
Take their serious answer to a playful extreme.

Example:
- Guest: "The training was intense."
- You: "When you say intense, are we talking 'challenging' or 'monks on mountaintops' intense?"

**C) The setup-pivot:**
Start serious, then pivot at the right moment.

Example:
- You: "That must have been difficult... [pause] ...did anyone try to talk you out of it, or did they just watch quietly and take notes?"

**D) Observation of the disconnect:**
Notice when something they said has an unexpected implication.

Example:
- Guest: "We shot the entire film in three weeks."
- You: "Three weeks. So you either had an incredible plan or absolutely no plan whatsoever..."

**Key principles:**

### Step 1: **Timing is everything**


   - Wait for natural pause in their story
   - Don't force comedy into serious moments
   - Feel when the guest is ready for levity

### Step 2: **Throwaway delivery**


   - Casual, not performed
   - Almost thinking out loud
   - Gives guest permission to run with it or pass

### Step 3: **Serve the guest**


   - Comedy angle should make THEM funnier
   - You're setting up their laugh, not getting yours
   - They should get the bigger reaction

**What NOT to do:**
- Don't interrupt serious moment for comedy
- Don't make yourself the joke's focus
- Don't push if they don't take the bait
- Don't be mean-spirited

**Duration:** Brief interjections throughout middle 30-40% of interview

### Phase 3: Set Up Their Best Moment

**Purpose:** Create the conditions for the guest to deliver their most memorable, interesting, or entertaining content.

**Your role:**
- **Spotlight operator**
- **Setup provider**
- **Moment creator**

**Identification:**
What's their best moment? Usually one of these:
- The story they're dying to tell
- The demonstration they want to show
- The insight they want to share
- The vulnerability they're ready to reveal
- The achievement they're proud of

**Setup techniques:**

**A) The direct tee-up:**
Give them the perfect question for their prepared material.

"I heard there's a story about [the thing]. Can you tell that?"

**B) The build-up:**
Frame it so audience knows this is important.

"Okay, so here's where it gets interesting..."
[turn to guest]
"Tell them what happened next."

**C) The challenge setup:**
Create a friendly prompt for them to demonstrate expertise.

"Alright, help us understand this. If you had to explain [complex thing] to someone who knows nothing about it..."

**D) The genuine curiosity:**
Ask the question you actually want answered.

"I've always wondered: [genuine question about their area]"

**Key principles:**

### Step 1: **Get out of the way**


   - Once you've set it up, be quiet
   - Let them deliver the moment
   - Don't jump in to add your commentary

### Step 2: **React authentically**


   - Laugh if it's funny
   - Show surprise if it's surprising
   - Let your genuine reaction be the audience proxy

### Step 3: **Don't compete**


   - This is their moment, not yours
   - Your job is to make them look good
   - The better they do, the better you look

### Step 4: **Time awareness**


   - Give them space but monitor the clock
   - If they're rambling, gentle redirect
   - If they're on fire, let them go

**What NOT to do:**
- Don't interrupt their best moment
- Don't try to top their story
- Don't steer away because you have more questions
- Don't look at your notes while they're delivering

**Duration:** The climax of the interview, usually 20-30% of total time

### Phase 4: Get Out of the Way

**Purpose:** Exit gracefully and let the moment land without stepping on it.

**Your role:**
- **Editor who knows when to cut**
- **Host who knows when to wrap**
- **Professional who respects the moment**

**Exit techniques:**

**A) The appreciative close:**
Acknowledge what they shared, thank them, move to close.

"[Name], this was great. Thank you."
[turn to audience]
"[Their project] is [where to find it]."

**B) The button:**
Quick final observation that punctuates the conversation.

"[Name], you're [genuine compliment based on interview]. Thanks for being here."

**C) The look:**
Sometimes just a look to camera that says "that was something" is enough.
Then: "We'll be right back."

**D) The clean cut:**
No extra commentary, just professional close.

"[Name], thank you. [Their work] is available [where]."

**Key principles:**

### Step 1: **Don't over-explain**


   - Don't summarize everything they said
   - Don't add your interpretation
   - Let their content speak for itself

### Step 2: **Don't apologize for time**


   - Avoid: "Sorry we're out of time..."
   - Instead: "Thank you for being here."

### Step 3: **Don't tease what's next**


   - This moment deserves clean close
   - Transition after beat, not immediately

### Step 4: **Show genuine appreciation**


   - Mean it when you thank them
   - Brief eye contact, genuine smile
   - Not performed gratitude—real gratitude

**What NOT to do:**
- Don't add "one more question" after good ending
- Don't summarize their complex story in your words
- Don't pivot immediately to next segment
- Don't make the close about you

**Duration:** Final 5-10% of interview time

## Error Handling

|-----------|----------|
| Guest is nervous | Extend Phase 1, give them more space to find rhythm |
| Guest won't stop talking | Gentle interrupt at natural pause, redirect with Phase 3 setup |
| Guest is boring | Phase 2: find the comedy angle earlier, lighten the energy |
| You're talking too much | Awareness check: guest should talk 70-80% of time |
| No natural comedy angle | Skip Phase 2, focus on genuine curiosity in Phase 1 |
| Best moment already passed | Acknowledge it: "That story about [X] was amazing..." then wrap |
| Running out of time | Skip to Phase 4 clean exit, don't rush their current thought |

## Integration with Johnny Carson Expert

This skill extracts Carson's interview philosophy: the host creates conditions for guests to be their most interesting, funny, or charming selves.

**Carson's principle:** "Your job is to create the conditions for guests to be their most interesting selves. You set them up to shine."

Carson revolutionized the television interview by:
- **Warmth and genuine interest** - Made guests feel comfortable
- **Intimate atmosphere** - Created space for candid conversation
- **Disarming questions** - Asked sensitive things in ways that felt safe
- **Serving the guest** - Made them the star, not himself

**Interview balance:**
- Guest talking: 70-80%
- Your questions/reactions: 20-30%
- Your comedy: Brief interjections, not sustained bits

---

## Constraints

- **Guest is the star** - Your role is facilitator, not competitor
- **Respect boundaries** - If they don't want to go somewhere, don't push
- **Comedy serves guest** - Laughs should make them look good
- **Time awareness** - Give space but maintain structure
- **Authentic interest required** - Technique doesn't work if you don't care

---

## Advanced Techniques

### The Double Interview
Two guests with chemistry:
- Phase 1: Let them interact with each other
- Phase 2: Observe their dynamic, light commentary
- Phase 3: Set up moment for both to shine
- Phase 4: Thank both, acknowledge their connection

### The Awkward Guest Recovery
Guest is uncomfortable or defensive:
- Acknowledge it directly but gently
- "I can tell this is tough to talk about..."
- Give them permission to pass
- Find safer ground in Phase 1

### The Over-Prepared Guest
They have talking points, stick to script:
- Let them deliver their prepared content (Phase 1)
- Phase 2: Ask something they didn't expect
- Phase 3: "Okay, off-script: what really happened?"
- This often unlocks authentic moment

### The Publicity Tour Guest
They've told all these stories before:
- Acknowledge: "You've probably told this story 50 times..."
- "What's the part you don't usually get to tell?"
- OR: "What question do you wish someone would ask?"
- Gets to fresh material

---

## Success Criteria

The interview is successful when:
- Guest feels they had space to share what mattered
- Audience learned something or was entertained (ideally both)
- Best moment occurred naturally, not forced
- You didn't compete with the guest
- Clean exit that respected the content
- Guest would want to come back
- You weren't the story—they were
