# Media Hoax Design

A skill for designing elaborate fictions that expose media credulity and teach critical thinking about information sources.

## When to Use

- When you want to demonstrate how easily media can be manipulated
- When teaching media literacy through experiential learning
- When exposing systemic failures in journalistic verification
- When creating art that uses media as its medium

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| input_data | Yes | The primary data or content to analyze |
| context | No | Additional background or constraints (default: none) |
| output_format | No | Preferred format for results (default: structured markdown) |

## Workflow
### Step 1: Phase 1: Identify Media Appetites

Study what journalists are hungry for:
- Trending topics and current anxieties
- Stories that confirm existing narratives
- Human interest angles that are "too good to check"
- Expert sources on emerging topics
- Novelty that fits familiar templates

The best hoaxes feed appetites. They give journalists what they already want to believe.

### Step 2: Phase 2: Design the Fiction

Create a story that:
- Is plausible enough to survive initial skepticism
- Is strange enough to be newsworthy
- Feeds the identified appetite perfectly
- Contains checkable details that appear to verify
- Has built-in explanation for why it hasn't been covered before

The fiction should be a mirror - reflecting the media's assumptions back at them.

### Step 3: Phase 3: Build the World

Create supporting infrastructure:
- Spokespeople with backstories
- Organization with history, mission, contact info
- Website, social media presence, letterhead
- "Satisfied customers" or "witnesses"
- Physical location if needed

Every element journalists might verify should check out.

### Step 4: Phase 4: Plant and Cultivate

Get the story into circulation:
- Press releases to appropriate outlets
- Tips to journalists covering relevant beats
- Social media presence that can be "discovered"
- Events or demonstrations that generate coverage

Patience is essential. Let journalists come to you.

### Step 5: Phase 5: Document Everything

Record the hoax's spread:
- Every outlet that covers it
- What verification (if any) each attempted
- How the story mutates through repetition
- Which journalists added embellishments

This documentation is essential for the reveal.

### Step 6: Phase 6: Reveal and Educate

Expose the hoax constructively:
- Explain exactly how it was done
- Show what verification would have caught it
- Analyze why journalists believed
- Teach the lesson without humiliating individuals

The reveal transforms deception into education.

## Output Format

A media hoax design including:
1. The lesson to be taught
2. The media appetite being fed
3. The fictional story and its elements
4. Infrastructure requirements
5. Planting strategy
6. Documentation plan
7. Reveal strategy with educational framing

## Constraints

- Plan the reveal from the start - without it, you're just lying
- Don't create hoaxes that could cause physical harm
- Consider legal implications (libel, fraud)
- Target institutional failures, not individual journalists
- Educational purpose must be genuine, not rationalization

## Outputs

**Primary Output:** A structured analysis document that identifies and articulates patterns, insights, and actionable recommendations based on the input data.

**Format:**
```markdown
## Analysis: [Topic]

### Key Findings
- [Finding 1]
- [Finding 2]
- [Finding 3]

### Recommendations
1. [Action 1]
2. [Action 2]
3. [Action 3]
```

**Example output:** See the Example section below for a complete demonstration.

## Additional Notes

**Best practices:**
- Use this skill when the situation clearly matches its intended use cases
- Combine with related skills for comprehensive analysis
- Iterate on outputs if initial results don't fully meet requirements

**Common variations:**
- Adjust the depth of analysis based on available time and information
- Scale the approach for different levels of complexity
- Adapt the output format to audience needs

**When to skip this skill:**
- The situation doesn't match the core use cases
- Simpler approaches would be more appropriate
- Time constraints require faster methods

## Example

**Input**: Expose media's failure to verify "expert" credentials

**Output**:
"Create fictional 'Institute for Social Media Psychology' with impressive website, fake academic credentials for founder. Offer expert commentary on social media's effects on children - a current media appetite. Track which outlets verify credentials (prediction: few). Reveal after multiple outlets quote 'expert,' showing how easily fake expertise enters news cycle. Educational focus: what verification journalists should do but don't."

## Integration

Works with:
- **hoax-infrastructure**: Building the supporting elements
- **media-appetite-analysis**: Identifying what journalists want
- **inoculation-reveal**: Structuring the educational exposure
