|-------|----------|-------------|
| subject | Yes | Product, feature, or idea to present |
| audience | Yes | Who will watch (customers, investors, employees, press) |
| key_messages | No | Core points to communicate (will be distilled to 3) |

## The Jobs Keynote Framework

### Principle 1: Start with Why It Matters

Never start with the product. Start with the problem.

**Jobs's pattern:**
1. Establish the current state is unacceptable
2. Paint a picture of the pain
3. Make the audience feel the frustration
4. THEN reveal the solution

**iPhone introduction (2007):**
> "The most advanced phones are called 'smartphones,' so they say. The problem is they're not so smart, and they're not so easy to use."

Jobs spent considerable time explaining why existing smartphones were terrible BEFORE revealing iPhone.

### Principle 2: The Rule of Three

Everything in threes. Human memory clusters in threes. Jobs never presented four things when three would do.

**Applications:**
- Three key features
- Three product lines
- Three reasons why
- Three demonstrations

**iPhone introduction:**
> "An iPod. A phone. An internet communicator."
> Repeated three times with icons.
> "These are NOT three separate devices. This is one device."

### Principle 3: Simplicity in Slides

Jobs's slides were often:
- One word
- One image
- One number
- One phrase

**Never:**
- Bullet points
- Paragraphs of text
- Busy charts
- Templates with logos and footers

**Rule:** If the audience is reading, they are not listening to you.

### Principle 4: The Headline Test

Every product deserves a headline - one phrase that captures everything.

| Product | Headline |
|---------|----------|
| iPod | "1,000 songs in your pocket" |
| MacBook Air | "The world's thinnest notebook" |
| iPhone | "Apple reinvents the phone" |

**Test:** Would this headline work on a billboard? If you need a paragraph, you have not found the essence.

### Principle 5: "One More Thing"

The surprise reveal near the end. Reserved for the most exciting announcement. Creates anticipation for every future presentation.

**Requirements:**
- Must be genuinely exciting
- Comes after the audience thinks the presentation is over
- Delivered casually: "Oh, and one more thing..."
- Not overused (Jobs saved it for truly special moments)

### Principle 6: Extensive Rehearsal

Jobs rehearsed for days. The apparent spontaneity was meticulously prepared.

**His process:**
- Rehearse segments individually
- Multiple full dress rehearsals
- Practice every demo
- Know exactly when to pause, when to build excitement
- Memorize transitions word-for-word

---

## Presentation Structure

### Opening: The Problem (2-3 minutes)

Establish why this presentation matters:

1. **The pain point** - What frustrates people today?
2. **Why it matters** - What are the consequences of this problem?
3. **Failed solutions** - Why haven't others solved this?

**Goal:** Audience should be nodding, feeling the problem viscerally.

### The Vision: What Great Looks Like (1-2 minutes)

Before revealing the solution, establish criteria:

1. What would the ideal solution look like?
2. What would it need to do?
3. What would success feel like?

**Goal:** Create a mental checklist that your product will satisfy.

### The Reveal: The Product (1 minute)

Simple, bold, dramatic:

1. Show the product
2. State the headline
3. Let it sink in

**Goal:** "Holy smokes" moment.

### The Three Pillars (70% of remaining time)

Present exactly three key aspects:

| Pillar | Content | Demo |
|--------|---------|------|
| **Pillar 1** | First major feature/benefit | Show it working |
| **Pillar 2** | Second major feature/benefit | Show it working |
| **Pillar 3** | Third major feature/benefit | Show it working |

Each pillar follows the same pattern:
1. Setup: Why this matters
2. Explanation: How it works (briefly)
3. Demo: Show, don't tell
4. Payoff: What this means for the user

### The Recap: Bring It Home (1-2 minutes)

Restate the three pillars. Use identical language from earlier.

> "So, we've shown you three things today:
> - [Pillar 1] - the first [X] that [benefit]
> - [Pillar 2] - [benefit description]
> - [Pillar 3] - and [benefit description]"

### The Close: Call to Action (1 minute)

End with:
1. Availability and pricing
2. Clear next step for audience
3. Bold closing statement

### (Optional) One More Thing (1-2 minutes)

If you have something truly surprising:
- Pause
- "Oh, and one more thing..."
- Reveal
- Let the audience react

## Output Format

```markdown
## Keynote Structure: [Subject]

### The Headline
> "[One phrase that captures everything]"

### Opening: The Problem

**The line:** "[What you'll say at the reveal]"

*Slide 3:* [Product image, nothing else]

### The Three Pillars

| Pillar | Key Message | Demo | Slide Content |
|--------|-------------|------|---------------|
| **1: [Name]** | [Why it matters] | [What to show] | [One word/image] |
| **2: [Name]** | [Why it matters] | [What to show] | [One word/image] |
| **3: [Name]** | [Why it matters] | [What to show] | [One word/image] |

### Rehearsal Notes

- [ ] Opening problem resonates emotionally
- [ ] Three pillars are distinct and memorable
- [ ] Every demo has been tested
- [ ] Slides contain minimal text
- [ ] Transitions are smooth
- [ ] Timing hits target
```

---

## Constraints

- Three pillars maximum; if you have four, you have not found focus
- No bullet points on slides; use the speaker's voice instead
- Every demo must be rehearsed and reliable
- "One more thing" is not for every presentation; reserve it
- Time allocations are guidelines; adjust to content

---

## Error Handling

| Situation | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| More than three key messages | Find the meta-theme; group into three |
| No clear headline | The product may lack focus; apply product-vision-frame |
| Demo cannot be made reliable | Show video instead; never risk live demo failure |
| "One more thing" isn't exciting enough | Don't use it; save for when you have something worthy |
| Audience is highly technical | Principles still apply; three pillars can be technical |

---

**Why this works:**

This example demonstrates the key principles of the skill in action. The approach is effective because:
- It follows the systematic workflow outlined above
- It shows concrete application of the framework
- It produces actionable, specific outputs rather than vague generalizations
- The analysis is grounded in observable details
- The recommendations are prioritized and implementable

**Alternative applications:**

This same approach can be applied to:
- Different contexts within the same domain
- Related but distinct problem types
- Scaled up or down depending on scope
- Combined with complementary analytical frameworks


## Keynote Structure: AI Writing Assistant Launch

### The Headline
> "Your first draft in 30 seconds."

### Opening: The Problem

**Pain point:** Every writer knows the terror of the blank page. You have ideas, but getting them out is painful. The first draft takes 80% of the effort and produces 20% of the quality.

**Stakes:** Writers spend hours staring at blank screens. They miss deadlines. They procrastinate. Some never finish.

**Failed solutions:** Other AI tools produce generic content no self-respecting writer would use. They're tools for non-writers. Writers need something different.

*Slide 1:* [Image of a blank page with a blinking cursor]

### The Vision

**Criteria for ideal solution:**
1. Produces a first draft you'd actually build on (not delete)
2. Sounds like YOU, not like a robot
3. Works in 30 seconds, not 30 minutes

*Slide 2:* The word "QUALITY" in large text

### The Reveal

**Moment:** After establishing the criteria, pause. Then:

**The line:** "Today we're introducing [Product Name]. Your first draft in 30 seconds."

*Slide 3:* Product logo, nothing else

### The Three Pillars

| Pillar | Key Message | Demo | Slide Content |
|--------|-------------|------|---------------|
| **1: Your Voice** | It learns how you write, not how "an AI" writes | Show it generating text in a distinctive style | "YOUR VOICE" |
| **2: 30 Seconds** | Brief prompt to complete first draft | Live timer as it generates | "30 SECONDS" |
| **3: Starting Point, Not Endpoint** | Designed for writers to build on, not to replace | Show editing flow, how drafts evolve | "FIRST DRAFT" |

### The Recap

> "Today we've shown you [Product Name]:
> - It writes in YOUR voice
> - It generates a first draft in 30 seconds
> - It's a starting point, designed for real writers to build on"

### The Close

**Availability:** Available today. Download at [URL].
**Call to action:** "Try it on your next piece. The first month is free."
**Closing line:** "Go finish something. Your first draft is waiting."

### One More Thing

**Reveal:** Integration with [Major Writing Software]
**Setup:** "Oh, and one more thing. We know you already have tools you love..."
**Why it's worthy:** Writers at a conference use this software; integration means immediate adoption

### Rehearsal Notes

- [ ] Opening resonates with blank page anxiety
- [ ] "Your Voice" demo uses recognizable author style
- [ ] 30-second demo is actually under 30 seconds
- [ ] All three demos work reliably
- [ ] Slides have no bullet points
- [ ] Total time under 20 minutes
