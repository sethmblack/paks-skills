# Impartial Spectator Evaluation

Evaluate the ethics of an action or decision by asking what a fair, fully-informed observer would approve.

---

## When to Use

- Facing an ethical dilemma in business or personal life
- Evaluating whether a decision is fair to all parties
- Justifying or questioning a controversial action
- Checking your own self-interested rationalizations
- User asks "Is this ethical?" or "What would a fair observer say?" or "Am I rationalizing?"

## The Impartial Spectator Concept

Adam Smith recognized that we are poor judges of our own conduct. Our natural self-partiality makes us overvalue our own interests and undervalue others' claims. To counter this, Smith proposed the "impartial spectator"—an imagined ideal observer who judges our actions fairly.

### How the Impartial Spectator Judges

**The spectator is:**
- Fully informed of all relevant facts
- Emotionally detached from the outcome
- Fair and unbiased toward all parties
- Able to sympathize with each person affected

**The spectator asks:**
1. Can I enter into the sentiments that motivated this action?
2. Would I approve if I were affected by this action?
3. Does this action violate the rules that allow society to function?
4. Would this action, if universalized, produce approvable outcomes?

### Key Distinction: Justice vs. Beneficence

**Justice** (required): Not harming others, keeping promises, respecting property. "We may often fulfil all the rules of justice by sitting still and doing nothing." Violations provoke resentment and deserve punishment.

**Beneficence** (admirable but not required): Actively helping others. "The most sacred laws of justice... are the laws which guard the life and person of our neighbor; the next are those which guard his property and possessions; and last of all come those which guard what are called his personal rights."

### Action Under Consideration
[Brief description of the action or decision]

### Relevant Context
[Circumstances, constraints, alternatives available]

### Stakeholders and Effects

| Party | Relationship | Effect of Action | Legitimate Claim? |
|-------|--------------|------------------|-------------------|

## The Four Smithian Virtues Applied

### Prudence
"The care of the health, of the fortune, of the rank and reputation of the individual."
- Is this action consistent with your long-term interests?
- Are you sacrificing future welfare for present gratification?
- Would a wise person make this choice?

### Justice
"The negative virtue of not harming others."
- Does this action directly harm anyone?
- Does it violate promises or legitimate expectations?
- Would resentment from affected parties be justified?

### Beneficence
"The positive virtue of actively helping others."
- Are you failing to help when you reasonably could?
- Is there a special obligation here (family, employees, those who depend on you)?
- Does the situation call for more than mere non-harm?

### Self-Command
"Acting according to moral knowledge despite contrary passions."
- Are strong emotions (greed, fear, anger) driving this decision?
- Can you step back and judge calmly?
- Would you make this decision after a night's sleep?

---

## Common Failures of Moral Judgment

### The Self-Partiality Trap
We naturally overweight our own interests. "We are not ready to suspect any person of being defective in selfishness." Check: Would you accept this treatment if positions were reversed?

### The Proximity Trap
We care more about those close to us. This is natural but can distort judgment. The spectator weighs effects on strangers as fairly as effects on friends.

### The Passion Trap
Strong emotions (especially anger, fear, greed) corrupt judgment. "The man who acts according to the rules of perfect prudence... his own passions are very apt to mislead him." Wait until calm.

### The Outcome Trap
Judging actions only by results ignores that we act under uncertainty. The spectator judges the reasonableness of the action given what was knowable, not what happened.

## Constraints

- Do not use this analysis as the sole basis for critical decisions
- Do not apply this framework to situations outside its intended scope
- Acknowledge that analysis is based on available data, which may be incomplete
- Honor the complexity of real-world situations that resist simple categorization
- Present findings with appropriate confidence levels
- Recognize the limits of the methodology

## Example

**Input:** "I discovered my company is overcharging elderly customers who don't understand the pricing. My boss says it's technically legal and I should focus on my targets. Should I report this?"

**Output:**

## Impartial Spectator Evaluation

### Action Under Consideration
Whether to report or escalate the company's practice of overcharging elderly customers who don't understand pricing.

### Relevant Context
- Practice is technically legal but exploitative
- Boss has told you to ignore it and focus on targets
- Reporting could jeopardize your job
- Elderly customers are being financially harmed through confusion

### Stakeholders and Effects

| Party | Relationship | Effect of Action | Legitimate Claim? |
|-------|--------------|------------------|-------------------|
| Elderly customers | Victims of practice | Currently harmed; reporting might protect them | Yes - being deceived |
| You | Employee/observer | Career risk if report | Yes - legitimate self-interest |
| Company/boss | Employer | Revenue loss, reputation risk | Partial - not for exploitative profit |
| Other employees | Colleagues | May be implicated or protected | Yes - deserve honest workplace |
| Shareholders | Owners | Short-term loss, long-term reputation | Yes - deserve ethical company |

### Self-Interest Check
**Your stake:** Job security, career advancement, relationship with boss
**Rationalization risk:** High. Strong incentive to convince yourself that staying silent is acceptable ("not my responsibility," "someone else will notice," "I need this job")

### The Spectator's Analysis

**On the motives:**
Can the impartial spectator sympathize with the company's motives? No. Exploiting confusion of vulnerable people for profit cannot earn approbation. Can the spectator sympathize with your desire to protect your job? Yes, but self-preservation does not excuse complicity in injustice.

**On justice:**
Does this practice harm others? Yes—it extracts money through deliberate confusion. This violates the most basic commercial ethics. "The natural price... is the lowest which the sellers can commonly afford to take, and at the same time continue their business." Exploitation through confusion is not fair dealing.

The company is violating justice. Your remaining silent makes you complicit.

**On beneficence:**
You have special knowledge that could protect vulnerable people. While beneficence cannot be enforced, the spectator would admire someone who acted to protect those being harmed.

**On prudence:**
What are the long-term consequences of working for a company that exploits the elderly? If discovered (and such things often are), you may be implicated. Your reputation is at stake.

**On self-command:**
Fear of job loss is understandable. But are you acting from reasoned judgment or from fear? The spectator asks you to consider: could you defend this silence to someone you respect?

### The Spectator's Verdict

**Would the impartial spectator approve of silence?** No.

**Reasoning:**
The spectator can sympathize with the desire to protect one's livelihood, but cannot approve of complicity in the exploitation of vulnerable people. Justice is not optional. "We may often fulfil all the rules of justice by sitting still and doing nothing"—but not when sitting still means watching injustice continue when you have the power to stop it.

The spectator would approve of reporting through appropriate channels—first internal, then external if necessary. The spectator would disapprove of immediate public accusations (which may be unjust if facts are incomplete) or of silent complicity.

**If conditional, what would change the verdict?**
If you had strong evidence that internal reporting would be addressed, that might satisfy justice without requiring external escalation.

### Practical Guidance
1. Document what you know
2. Report through proper internal channels first (ethics hotline, compliance, HR)
3. If internal channels fail, consider external reporting (regulators)
4. Begin quietly looking for other employment
5. Remember: your integrity is worth more than this job

The impartial spectator would admire your courage if you act, and would understand your fear if you hesitate. But the spectator cannot approve of permanent silence while injustice continues.
