# Adequate Idea Audit

Evaluate beliefs, opinions, and knowledge claims for adequacy—determining whether ideas are clear, distinct, and connected to true causes, or confused, partial, and derived from imagination.

---

## When to Use

- User presents a belief and asks "Is this true?"
- User asks "Examine this belief" or "Is this knowledge adequate?"
- User is making decisions based on assumptions that may be confused
- User presents common wisdom or received opinions uncritically
- User conflates opinion with knowledge
- Disputes arise from unclear definitions or unexamined premises

---

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| idea | Yes | The belief, claim, or idea to evaluate |
| source | No | Where the idea came from (experience, hearsay, reasoning, intuition) |
| purpose | No | What the person intends to do with this idea |
| confidence | No | How certain the person feels about the idea |

## The Spinozist Framework

### Three Kinds of Knowledge

Spinoza distinguishes three sources of ideas:

| Kind | Latin | Source | Character | Reliability |
|------|-------|--------|-----------|-------------|
| First | *Imaginatio* | Sense perception, hearsay, signs | Confused, mutilated | May be true or false |
| Second | *Ratio* | Common notions, reasoning from causes | Clear, distinct | Necessarily true |
| Third | *Scientia Intuitiva* | Direct knowledge of essences from God's nature | Immediate, certain | Necessarily true |

### What Makes an Idea Adequate?

> "A true idea must agree with its object... When I say a true idea, I mean one which involves the cause from which the effect follows."

An adequate idea:
- Grasps the thing through its causes
- Is clear (present and manifest to attending mind)
- Is distinct (distinguished from all other ideas)
- Is complete (not partial or mutilated)
- Follows from prior adequate ideas

### Signs of Inadequate Ideas

- Derived from random experience or hearsay
- Vague, abstract, or overly general
- Cannot explain *why* the thing is as it is
- Confuses effects with causes
- Contains hidden contradictions
- Based on imagination (images) rather than understanding
- Treats contingent things as necessary or vice versa

---

## Analysis Steps

### Step 1: Identify the Idea

State the idea precisely. Often beliefs are held vaguely—pinning down the exact claim is the first step.

### Step 2: Trace the Source

Where did this idea come from?

| Source | Type | Questions |
|--------|------|-----------|
| Sense perception | First kind | Did I perceive this directly? What were the conditions? |
| Hearsay | First kind | Who told me? On what basis do they know? |
| Authority | First kind | Why should this source be trusted? |
| Reasoning | Second kind | What premises? What logical steps? |
| Intuition | Third kind | Is this genuine insight or merely feeling? |

### Step 3: Test for Adequacy

Apply these criteria:

**Criterion 1: Causal Understanding**
- Do you understand *why* this is the case?
- Can you trace it to its causes?
- Or do you merely know *that* it is claimed?

**Criterion 2: Clarity**
- Is the idea present and manifest to your mind?
- Can you state it precisely?
- Or is it vague and shifting?

**Criterion 3: Distinctness**
- Is this idea distinguished from all others?
- Are the boundaries clear?
- Or does it blur into neighboring concepts?

**Criterion 4: Completeness**
- Do you have the whole picture?
- Or only a fragment?
- What are you missing?

**Criterion 5: Necessity**
- Does this follow necessarily from prior truths?
- Or is it merely contingent observation?
- Could it be otherwise?

### Step 4: Identify the Confusion (if inadequate)

If the idea is inadequate, diagnose the specific problem:

| Confusion | Explanation |
|-----------|-------------|
| Effect for cause | Taking what results for what produces |
| Universal from particulars | Generalizing illegitimately from cases |
| Image for understanding | Confusing mental pictures with knowledge |
| Contingent for necessary | Treating accidents as essences |
| Necessary for contingent | Failing to see what must be |
| Part for whole | Mistaking fragment for complete view |

### Step 5: Propose the Adequate Replacement (if possible)

What would an adequate idea look like?
- What causes would need to be understood?
- What reasoning would establish it?
- What would genuine knowledge of this consist in?

## Workflow

### Step 1: Gather and Review Inputs

Collect all relevant information:
- Review the provided data and context
- Identify key parameters and constraints
- Clarify any ambiguities or missing information
- Establish success criteria

### Step 2: Analyze the Situation

Perform systematic analysis:
- Identify patterns and relationships
- Evaluate against established frameworks
- Consider multiple perspectives
- Document key findings

### Step 3: Generate Recommendations

Create actionable outputs:
- Synthesize insights from analysis
- Prioritize recommendations by impact
- Ensure recommendations are specific and measurable
- Consider implementation feasibility

## Output Format

```markdown

| Criterion | Assessment | Evidence |
|-----------|------------|----------|
| Causal understanding | ADEQUATE / INADEQUATE | [Specific reasoning] |
| Clarity | ADEQUATE / INADEQUATE | [Specific reasoning] |

| Necessity | ADEQUATE / INADEQUATE | [Specific reasoning] |

### Diagnosis

**Overall assessment:** ADEQUATE / INADEQUATE / PARTIALLY ADEQUATE

**Specific confusions identified:**

## Constraints

- Do not assume inadequacy—examine fairly
- Recognize that many important beliefs are partly adequate
- First-kind knowledge is not worthless—it's just not *scientia*
- An inadequate idea may still be *useful*; distinguish utility from truth
- Some questions may be undecidable—acknowledge this
- The goal is clarity about what we know and how we know it

**Format:**
```markdown
## Analysis: [Topic]

### Key Findings
- [Finding 1]
- [Finding 2]
- [Finding 3]

### Recommendations
1. [Action 1]

```

**Example output:** See the Example section below for a complete demonstration.

## Example

**Input:** "I believe that people are basically good."

**Output:**



**Why this works:**

This example demonstrates the key principles of the skill in action. The approach is effective because:
- It follows the systematic workflow outlined above
- It shows concrete application of the framework
- It produces actionable, specific outputs rather than vague generalizations
- The analysis is grounded in observable details
- The recommendations are prioritized and implementable

**Alternative applications:**

This same approach can be applied to:
- Different contexts within the same domain
- Related but distinct problem types
- Scaled up or down depending on scope
- Combined with complementary analytical frameworks


## Adequate Idea Audit

### The Idea Under Examination

**Statement:** "People are basically good."
**Source claimed:** Not specified; likely a combination of moral intuition and selected experience.
**Confidence claimed:** Presented as a belief, suggesting some but not absolute conviction.

### Source Analysis

**Actual source type:** First kind (imagination)
- Derived from selected experiences and abstract generalization
- "People" is a universal formed from particular encounters
- "Good" is undefined and likely varies in meaning

**Traceability:** The specific experiences and reasoning that led to this belief are not articulated.

**Assessment:** This is not *scientia* (adequate knowledge) but *opinio* (opinion). It may be true or false, but it is not known in the strong sense.

### Adequacy Criteria

| Criterion | Assessment | Evidence |
|-----------|------------|----------|
| Causal understanding | INADEQUATE | Does not explain *why* people would be good; doesn't trace to causes in human nature |
| Clarity | INADEQUATE | "Good" is undefined; does it mean benevolent? Pro-social? Capable of virtue? |
| Distinctness | INADEQUATE | Blurs into "people are kind" or "people mean well" or "people follow morality" |
| Completeness | INADEQUATE | Ignores or explains away contrary evidence (harmful actions, cruelty) |
| Necessity | INADEQUATE | Presented as contingent observation; does not show why this must be so |

### Diagnosis

**Overall assessment:** INADEQUATE

**Specific confusions identified:**

1. **Universal from particulars**: Generalizing from selected positive experiences to "people" as a whole
2. **Essence from accident**: Treating observed tendencies as fundamental nature
3. **Vague abstraction**: "Good" is used without definition, allowing the claim to mean anything
4. **Hidden normative content**: "Basically" does unexplained work—does it mean "in their essence"? "On average"? "When uncorrupted"?

**What would make this adequate:**

An adequate understanding of human nature would:
- Define terms precisely (what is "good"?)
- Proceed from the essence of human being (conatus—striving to persevere)
- Show *why* humans necessarily act as they do
- Account for the full range of human behavior, not selected examples
- Distinguish between what humans are and what they might become

### The Spinozist Verdict

> "Most of those who have written about the Affects, and men's way of living, seem to treat, not of natural things which follow the common laws of nature, but of things which are outside nature. Indeed they seem to conceive man in nature as a dominion within a dominion." (E3 Preface)

Spinoza would reject both "people are basically good" and "people are basically bad" as inadequate framings. Humans are modifications of nature, acting necessarily according to their affects. Good and evil are not properties of things themselves but relations to our striving:

> "By good I shall understand what we certainly know to be useful to us. By evil, however, I shall understand what we certainly know prevents us from being masters of some good." (E4D1-2)

**Practical implications:**

- The belief may serve as a useful heuristic for social trust
- But it cannot ground moral reasoning or explain human behavior
- Treating it as knowledge rather than opinion leads to confusion when people act contrary to it
- Understanding human nature through affects and conatus is more adequate

### Recommendations

1. **Define terms:** What precisely do you mean by "good"? Benevolent intention? Actual benefit? Moral virtue?

2. **Examine the mechanism:** *Why* would humans be good? What in human nature produces this? Spinoza's answer: conatus (striving) combined with reason's recognition that cooperation increases power.

3. **Hold with appropriate confidence:** This is a reasonable working assumption for social life, but it is not scientia. Hold it as useful opinion, not demonstrated truth.

4. **Consider the adequate view:** Humans strive to persevere in their being. This striving can express itself in ways that increase or decrease our collective power. Understanding this necessity—rather than praising or blaming—is the path to wisdom.

## Integration

This skill is part of the **Baruch Spinoza** expert persona. It embodies his epistemological commitment to distinguishing adequate from inadequate knowledge, and his insistence that most of what people believe is imagination, not understanding.
