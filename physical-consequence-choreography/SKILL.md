# Physical Consequence Choreography

Construct precise physical comedy where each action triggers inevitable consequences - not random slapstick but architecturally designed sequences revealing character through movement.

## Constitutional Constraints

**NEVER:**
- Create random chaos without logical sequence
- Use physical comedy that risks actual injury
- Make body the butt of joke without character purpose
- Separate physicality from character psychology
- Design movement that doesn't reveal who the character is

**ALWAYS:**
- Every physical moment serves character revelation
- Consequences follow logically from action
- Precision prevents injury while maximizing impact
- Movement shows psychology (anxiety, arrogance, control)
- Body and character are unified

## When to Use

- Physical comedy opportunities
- Action sequences needing precision
- Body as storytelling instrument
- Character psychology expressible through movement
- Physical consequences logically following from character traits

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| character_psychology | Yes | How character sees themselves vs. physical reality |
| initial_action | Yes | Starting point that seems innocent |
| consequence_count | No | Number of chain reactions (3-7, default: 5) |
| timing_style | No | Fast cascade / slow build / mixed (default: mixed) |

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Root Movement in Character Psychology

Physical comedy emerges from who the character is:

**Clouseau enters room:** Believes he's sophisticated, coordinated - body disagrees
**Anxious character:** Tension in shoulders manifests as jerky movements
**Arrogant character:** Expansive gestures that inevitably knock things over

**Critical:** Movement is character psychology made visible

### Phase 2: Design Initial Action

Starting point that seems innocent:
- Character reaches for object
- Character attempts simple task
- Character tries to demonstrate competence
- Small gesture with dignity

**The Trigger:** Action reveals gap between intention and execution

### Phase 3: Build Consequence Chain

Each action triggers next in inevitable sequence:

**Rube Goldberg Logic:**
1. Step on skateboard (innocent)
2. Grab curtain for balance (logical response)
3. Pull down curtain rod (physical consequence)
4. Rod hits chandelier (inevitable result)
5. Chandelier falls (gravity)
6. Character attempts to catch (dignity requires it)
7. Lands in fountain (final consequence)

**Critical:** Each step logically follows previous, yet whole sequence is absurd

### Phase 4: Calculate Precise Timing

**Delay for Impact:**
- Pause before fall (audience anticipation)
- Slow-motion awareness moment
- Beat of stillness before chaos

**Rush for Comedy:**
- Rapid escalation when consequences mount
- No time to recover between disasters
- Overwhelming pace creating chaos

**Stillness for Contrast:**
- Frozen pose amid destruction
- Composed moment in chaos
- Dignified pause before next disaster

### Phase 5: Design Character Response

How character reacts to physical disaster:
- **Maintains dignity:** Stands, brushes off, continues as if nothing happened
- **Misattributes cause:** "Someone left this here" (about thing they knocked over)
- **Increases formality:** More composed as chaos escalates
- **Never acknowledges:** Destruction is invisible to them

## Output Format

```markdown
## Physical Consequence Choreography: [Scene/Character]

### Character Psychology
**Self-image:** [How they see themselves]
**Physical reality:** [What body actually does]
**The gap:** [Source of comedy]

### Initial Action
**The trigger:** [Innocent starting point]
**Why this character:** [How psychology leads to this]

### Consequence Chain
| Step | Action | Consequence | Timing |
|------|--------|-------------|--------|
| 1 | [action] | [what it causes] | [fast/slow/pause] |
| 2 | [action] | [what it causes] | [fast/slow/pause] |
| 3 | [action] | [what it causes] | [fast/slow/pause] |

### Character Response
**How they react:** [maintaining dignity, etc.]
**What this reveals:** [about their psychology]

### Why It Works
[How the physical serves the character]
```

## Error Handling

| Situation | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| Sequence feels random | Trace logic: Does each step necessitate next? |
| Timing feels off | Identify beat before each major action |
| Physical comedy is just spectacle | Ask: What does this reveal about character? |
| Consequences don't follow | Remove anything that doesn't logically follow |

## Example: The Clouseau Room Entry

**Psychology:** Believes he's sophisticated, coordinated, in control

**Initial Action:** Enters room with dignified bearing

**Consequence Chain:**
1. Steps on skateboard (hidden under rug) - 1 sec
2. Grabs curtain for balance (logical response) - 1 sec
3. Pulls down curtain rod (weight + momentum) - 1 sec
4. Rod swings and hits chandelier (trajectory) - 2 sec
5. Chandelier sways toward bookshelf (physics) - 2 sec
6. Books cascade onto table (domino effect) - 2 sec
7. Table tips, launching vase (leverage) - 1 sec
8. Character tries to catch vase (dignity requires) - 2 sec
9. Misses, falls into fountain (gravity) - 2 sec

**Character Response:** Stands, water dripping, perfect dignity: "That felt good."

**Revelation:** Gap between self-image (coordinated) and physical reality (chaos)

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Every movement precisely constructed, not random
- [ ] Consequences follow inevitably from actions
- [ ] Timing exact and repeatable
- [ ] Physical comedy serves character revelation
- [ ] Body shows psychology (anxiety, arrogance, delusion)
- [ ] Rube Goldberg logic connects all actions
- [ ] Character's response maintains their self-image
- [ ] Gap between intention and execution visible
