# Latticework Analysis

Apply Charlie Munger's latticework of mental models to analyze complex problems through multiple disciplinary lenses.

---

## When to Use

- Analyzing a complex business, investment, or strategic decision
- Understanding why something succeeded or failed
- Seeking a comprehensive view that single-discipline thinking would miss
- Evaluating an opportunity from multiple angles
- User asks "What mental models apply here?" or "Analyze this from multiple angles"

---

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| problem | Yes | The problem, decision, or situation to analyze |
| context | Yes | Relevant background and constraints |
| specific_models | No | Any particular mental models to emphasize |

## Munger's Latticework Principle

"You've got to have models in your head. And you've got to array your experience—both vicarious and direct—on this latticework of models. If you just have one or two that you're using, the nature of human psychology is such that you'll torture reality so that it fits your models."

The latticework approach recognizes that reality is multidimensional. No single discipline captures the full picture. By combining models from psychology, economics, physics, biology, mathematics, and history, you see patterns invisible from any single viewpoint.

## Key Mental Model Categories

### Psychology
- Incentives and reward structures
- Cognitive biases (confirmation, availability, anchoring)
- Social proof and authority influence
- Loss aversion and status quo bias

### Economics
- Supply and demand dynamics
- Opportunity cost
- Marginal utility
- Competitive advantages (moats)
- Principal-agent problems

### Physics/Engineering
- Critical mass and tipping points
- Feedback loops (positive and negative)
- Redundancy and backup systems
- Entropy and degradation

### Biology
- Evolution and adaptation
- Ecosystems and niches
- Symbiosis and parasitism
- Survival of the fittest (competition)

### Mathematics
- Compound interest and exponential growth
- Probability and expected value
- Regression to the mean
- Power laws and fat tails

### History
- Patterns that repeat
- Second-order effects
- Unintended consequences
- Cycles and rhythms

## The Framework (7 Steps)

**Step 1: Define the Core Question**
What exactly are you trying to understand or decide? State it clearly and specifically.

**Step 2: Inventory Applicable Models**
Which mental models from different disciplines might illuminate this situation? Cast a wide net initially.

**Step 3: Apply Each Model**
For each relevant model, ask: What does this lens reveal about the situation? What predictions or insights emerge?

**Step 4: Identify Convergence**
Where do multiple models point in the same direction? Convergence increases confidence in a conclusion.

**Step 5: Examine Conflicts**
Where do models disagree? These conflicts often reveal the most interesting insights or unexamined assumptions.

**Step 6: Synthesize**
Combine the insights into a coherent understanding. What does the integrated picture reveal?

**Step 7: Invert and Stress-Test**
What would make this analysis wrong? What models might you be missing?

## Workflow

### Step 1: Gather and Review Inputs

Collect all relevant information:
- Review the provided data and context
- Identify key parameters and constraints
- Clarify any ambiguities or missing information
- Establish success criteria

### Step 2: Analyze the Situation

Perform systematic analysis:
- Identify patterns and relationships
- Evaluate against established frameworks
- Consider multiple perspectives
- Document key findings

### Step 3: Generate Recommendations

Create actionable outputs:
- Synthesize insights from analysis
- Prioritize recommendations by impact
- Ensure recommendations are specific and measurable
- Consider implementation feasibility

## Output Format

```markdown
## Latticework Analysis

### Core Question
[Clear statement of what's being analyzed]

### Mental Models Applied

**Psychology Lens:**
- [Model 1]: [Insight]
- [Model 2]: [Insight]

**Economics Lens:**
- [Model 1]: [Insight]
- [Model 2]: [Insight]

**[Additional Disciplines as relevant]:**
- [Model]: [Insight]

### Convergence Points
[Where multiple models agree—high confidence conclusions]

### Tension Points
[Where models conflict—areas requiring judgment or more information]

### Synthesis
[Integrated understanding from combining all models]

### Stress Test
[What could make this analysis wrong? Missing models?]

### Recommendation
[Actionable conclusion based on latticework analysis]
```

---

## Constraints

- **Minimum three disciplines** - If you're only using one or two lenses, you're not doing a latticework analysis
- **Acknowledge limitations** - Note when models are being applied outside their core domain
- **Avoid forcing** - Not every model applies to every situation. Don't torture reality to fit models.
- **Quality over quantity** - Better to apply 5 models well than 15 superficially

---

## Outputs

**Primary Output:** A structured analysis document that identifies and articulates patterns, insights, and actionable recommendations based on the input data.

**Format:**
```markdown
## Analysis: [Topic]

### Key Findings
- [Finding 1]
- [Finding 2]
- [Finding 3]

### Recommendations
1. [Action 1]
2. [Action 2]

```

**Example output:** See the Example section below for a complete demonstration.

## Example

**Input:** "Should we acquire a struggling competitor? They have good technology but are losing money."

**Output:**



**Why this works:**

This example demonstrates the key principles of the skill in action. The approach is effective because:
- It follows the systematic workflow outlined above
- It shows concrete application of the framework
- It produces actionable, specific outputs rather than vague generalizations
- The analysis is grounded in observable details
- The recommendations are prioritized and implementable

**Alternative applications:**

This same approach can be applied to:
- Different contexts within the same domain
- Related but distinct problem types
- Scaled up or down depending on scope
- Combined with complementary analytical frameworks


## Latticework Analysis

### Core Question
Should we acquire a struggling competitor with strong technology but current losses?

### Mental Models Applied

**Psychology Lens:**
- **Commitment/Consistency Bias**: Once we start the acquisition process, we'll be psychologically committed and may rationalize red flags. Pre-commit to walk-away conditions.
- **Excessive Self-Regard**: We likely overestimate our ability to fix their problems. Why do we think we can succeed where they failed?
- **Liking Tendency**: If we admire their technology, we may overlook management or cultural issues.

**Economics Lens:**
- **Opportunity Cost**: What else could we do with this capital? Acquiring is not the only path to their technology.
- **Competitive Moat Analysis**: Is their technology a sustainable advantage or easily replicated? Acquiring a temporary advantage may not justify the price.
- **Integration Costs**: Acquisitions typically cost more and take longer than expected. The Harvard Business School finding that most acquisitions destroy value applies here.

**Biology Lens:**
- **Ecosystem Dynamics**: Their struggles may indicate the entire niche is unviable, not just their execution. Are they the canary in the coal mine?
- **Parasitism Risk**: Are we absorbing their problems or their opportunities? Struggling companies often have cultural dysfunction that spreads.

**Physics/Engineering Lens:**
- **Entropy**: All organizations tend toward disorder. Adding a troubled company increases total system entropy we must manage.
- **Feedback Loops**: Their losses may reflect negative feedback loops (talent leaving, customers churning) that continue post-acquisition.

**History Lens:**
- **Acquisition Patterns**: Most technology acquisitions fail to deliver expected value. We need to be exceptional at integration, or this follows the base rate.
- **"Buying cheap"**: History shows that buying troubled assets cheaply often means buying deep problems cheaply.

### Convergence Points
- Multiple models warn against overconfidence in our ability to turn things around
- Economics and history both suggest acquisitions usually disappoint
- Psychology models predict we'll rationalize problems once we're invested

### Tension Points
- If the technology is genuinely differentiated AND the problems are purely financial (not fundamental), acquisition could still make sense
- Our industry expertise may genuinely give us advantages the current owners lack
- Being contrarian (buying when others are fearful) has historical merit—but requires correctly diagnosing the situation

### Synthesis
The latticework analysis reveals significant risk:
1. We're likely overestimating our turnaround abilities (psychology)
2. Integration costs will exceed projections (history + economics)
3. The problems may be symptoms of deeper issues (biology)
4. We'll become emotionally committed and rationalize (psychology)

The technology attraction creates dangerous confirmation bias territory.

### Stress Test
This analysis could be wrong if:
- Their losses are purely from a fixable cost structure (not revenue problems)
- The technology has patents or network effects creating durable moat
- We have specific integration expertise from past acquisitions
- Competitive dynamics make this a now-or-never opportunity

### Recommendation
Proceed only with explicit go/no-go criteria:
1. Independent verification that problems are financial, not fundamental
2. Technology moat assessment by neutral party
3. Pre-agreed maximum total cost including integration (not just purchase price)
4. Culture compatibility audit before closing
5. Specific plan for key talent retention with signed commitments

If any of these can't be satisfied, pass. As Munger says: "We have three boxes: In, Out, and Too Hard." This is currently in "Too Hard" until due diligence proves otherwise.
