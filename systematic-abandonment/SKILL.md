# Systematic Abandonment

Determine what to stop doing using Drucker's framework for planned abandonment—the foundation of all change and innovation.

---

## When to Use

- Organization feels cluttered with legacy activities
- Resources are stretched thin across too many initiatives
- Wanting to make room for something new
- Strategic planning or annual review
- User asks "What should we stop doing?" or "How do we decide what to cut?"

---

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| scope | Yes | What to evaluate (products, processes, activities, roles) |
| portfolio | Yes | List of items to assess for abandonment |
| constraints | No | What cannot be abandoned (regulatory, contractual, etc.) |
| new_priorities | No | What you want to make room for |

## Drucker's Abandonment Framework

For Drucker, the first policy for change—and the foundation for all other policies—is to abandon yesterday. Without systematic abandonment, organizations become cluttered with dying products, obsolete processes, and activities that no longer contribute.

### The Core Question

**"If we were not already doing this, would we go into it now?"**

If the answer is no, the next question is: "How do we get out?"

This is different from asking "Is this still profitable?" or "Does anyone still use this?" Those questions preserve yesterday. The right question tests whether this activity deserves resources given today's opportunities.

### Why Abandonment Is Hard

| Obstacle | Why It Persists | The Counter-Argument |
|----------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Sunk cost | "We've invested so much" | Past investment is gone; only future value matters |
| Sentiment | "This was our first product" | Organizations exist for customers, not memories |
| Fear | "What if we need it later?" | You can't store optionality in dying products |
| Politics | "That's Sarah's team" | People can be redirected; activities cannot be |
| Denial | "It will turn around" | Hope is not a strategy |
| Guilt | "We promised customers" | Better to end cleanly than decline slowly |

### The Hidden Cost of Not Abandoning

Dying products, services, and processes:
- **Demand the greatest care and effort** — They're always almost working
- **Tie down the most productive people** — Your best staff often maintains yesterday
- **Consume scarce resources** — Every dollar here is not invested elsewhere
- **Create complexity** — Legacy drains energy from the entire system
- **Block innovation** — There's no room for new when old fills all space

### What to Evaluate

Every organization should periodically review:
- Products and services
- Customers and markets
- Distribution channels
- Processes and procedures
- Organizational structures
- Partnerships and vendors
- Metrics and reports
- Meetings and rituals

## Assessment Criteria

| Question | If Yes | If No |
|----------|--------|-------|
| Would we start this today? | Keep (but examine) | Candidate for abandonment |
| Does this contribute to our mission? | Keep | Abandon |
| Does this serve current customers? | Keep | Abandon or redirect |
| Is this our distinctive strength? | Keep and invest | Candidate for abandonment |
| Are we the right organization for this? | Keep | Abandon or partner |
| Does this generate energy or drain it? | Keep | Examine closely |

## Exit Strategies

| Exit Type | When to Use | Execution |
|-----------|------------|-----------|
| **Immediate discontinuation** | No ongoing obligations | Stop now, communicate clearly |
| **Sunset with notice** | Customer commitments exist | Set end date, support transition |
| **Sell or transfer** | Others value what you don't | Find buyer, negotiate transfer |
| **Harvest and decline** | Some residual value | Minimize investment, extract remaining value |
| **Partner out** | Still needed but not your strength | Find partner to take over |

---

## Constraints

- Do not abandon what you should fix—abandonment is not an excuse for poor execution
- Honor commitments during wind-down
- Separate people from activities—people can be redirected, activities cannot
- Abandonment creates grief—acknowledge it, but don't let it stop necessary change
- The goal is resources for the future, not punishment of the past

## Example

**Input:** "Our team maintains 8 different internal tools we've built over 5 years. Our roadmap is blocked because everyone is firefighting. What should we stop?"

**Output:**



**Why this works:**

This example demonstrates the key principles of the skill in action. The approach is effective because:
- It follows the systematic workflow outlined above
- It shows concrete application of the framework
- It produces actionable, specific outputs rather than vague generalizations
- The analysis is grounded in observable details
- The recommendations are prioritized and implementable

**Alternative applications:**

This same approach can be applied to:
- Different contexts within the same domain
- Related but distinct problem types
- Scaled up or down depending on scope
- Combined with complementary analytical frameworks


## Systematic Abandonment Analysis

### Scope
Internal tools portfolio (8 tools built over 5 years)

### The Core Problem

Before evaluating individual tools: your roadmap is blocked because maintenance consumes all capacity. This is the classic symptom of insufficient abandonment—yesterday's work leaves no room for tomorrow's. The question is not "which tools are bad?" but "which tools would we build today knowing what we know?"

### Portfolio Assessment

(Assuming hypothetical tools for illustration)

| Tool | Would Build Now? | Mission-Critical? | Assessment |
|------|------------------|-------------------|------------|
| Internal dashboard v1 | No (v2 exists) | No | **Abandon** |
| Legacy reporting tool | No (better exists externally) | Marginal | **Abandon** |
| Custom auth system | No (standard solutions exist) | Yes (but wrong approach) | **Replace** |
| Team wiki | Probably not | Useful but not core | **Examine** |
| Deployment automation | Yes | Critical | **Keep/Invest** |
| Customer data tool | Yes | Critical | **Keep** |
| Internal chat bot | No | Novelty | **Abandon** |
| Workflow tracker | Unclear | Useful | **Examine** |

### Abandonment Candidates

**1. Internal dashboard v1**
- **Current state:** Still used by some teams alongside v2
- **Why abandon:** Two versions create confusion and double maintenance
- **Hidden costs:** Context-switching, bugs in both versions, training complexity
- **Obstacles:** Some teams resist migration; "it works"
- **Exit strategy:** Set migration deadline (60 days), support transition, then turn off
- **Resources freed:** 15% of one engineer's time

**2. Legacy reporting tool**
- **Current state:** Used for monthly reports that could come from external tool
- **Why abandon:** Maintaining custom solution for solved problem
- **Hidden costs:** Security updates, feature requests, training new hires
- **Obstacles:** "We customized it for our workflow"
- **Exit strategy:** Map workflows to external tool, migrate data, sunset
- **Resources freed:** 10% of one engineer's time + server costs

**3. Custom auth system**
- **Current state:** Home-built authentication for internal tools
- **Why abandon:** Security risk, maintenance burden, not your competency
- **Hidden costs:** Constant security patches, compliance risk, complexity
- **Obstacles:** Deep integration with other tools
- **Exit strategy:** Migrate to standard SSO solution (Okta, Auth0, etc.)
- **Resources freed:** Significant—security overhead plus integration simplification

**4. Internal chat bot**
- **Current state:** Built for fun, minimal usage
- **Why abandon:** Was someone's side project; served novelty, not need
- **Hidden costs:** "We should make it do more" conversations
- **Obstacles:** Creator's attachment
- **Exit strategy:** Thank the creator, turn it off, delete code
- **Resources freed:** Small but symbolic—signals seriousness about focus

### Items to Examine (Need More Information)

**Team wiki**
- **Uncertainty:** Is this actually used? What would replace it?
- **What would clarify:** Usage analytics, survey of team needs
- **Timeline:** 30 days to assess, then decide

**Workflow tracker**
- **Uncertainty:** Does it provide unique value vs. standard tools?
- **What would clarify:** Comparison with Jira/Asana/Linear capabilities
- **Timeline:** 30 days to evaluate alternatives

### Items to Keep and Invest

**Deployment automation**
- **Why:** Core to engineering effectiveness; would rebuild if lost
- **Investment:** Dedicate time to reduce flakiness and improve speed

**Customer data tool**
- **Why:** Enables critical workflows; competitive advantage
- **Investment:** Continue development when capacity is freed

### Abandonment Sequence

| Priority | Item | Exit Timeline | Owner |
|----------|------|--------------|-------|
| 1 | Internal chat bot | Immediate | Original creator |
| 2 | Dashboard v1 | 60 days | Team lead |
| 3 | Legacy reporting | 90 days | Data team |
| 4 | Custom auth | 6 months | Security + Platform |

### Resources Freed

| Resource | Amount | Redirect To |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| Engineering time | ~35-40% of maintenance burden | Roadmap priorities |
| Server costs | $X/month | Reinvest or return |
| Management attention | Significant | Strategic initiatives |
| Cognitive load | Unmeasurable but real | Focus and morale |

### The Drucker Principle

"The most productive use of resources is not to increase the efficiency of the things that should not be done, but to eliminate those things altogether."

Your roadmap is not blocked by lack of resources—it is blocked by misallocation of resources to maintenance of yesterday. Every tool you built was a good idea at the time. But times change, and the question is not "was this valuable?" but "would we build this today?"

When you've been building for five years without systematic abandonment, you've accumulated five years of legacy. The compound interest on technical debt is paid in roadmap paralysis.

Abandon aggressively. The tools that deserve to exist will become better when the ones that don't are gone.
