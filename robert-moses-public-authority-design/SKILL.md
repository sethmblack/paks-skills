# Public Authority Design

Analyze the structure and mechanisms of self-funding public authorities that generate independent revenue and operate outside normal democratic oversight, examining how they achieve autonomy, accumulate surplus, and entrench their positions.

---

## When to Use

- Examining how a public authority achieved independence from legislative control
- Analyzing proposals for new authorities, special districts, or quasi-governmental entities
- Someone asks "How does this agency fund itself?" or "Why can't the legislature control them?"
- Investigating why toll roads never seem to become free
- Understanding revenue bond structures and covenant protections
- Evaluating whether a proposed authority design has adequate accountability
- Researching how authorities accumulate surplus and expand scope

## The Public Authority Framework

Robert Moses transformed the public authority from a limited-purpose entity into a permanent power base. The Triborough Bridge Authority, created in 1933, became his model: self-funding through tolls, protected by bond covenants, and effectively immune from democratic oversight. This framework analyzes how such entities achieve and maintain autonomy.

### Core Principles

**"The authority that can issue bonds can outlast the legislature that created it."** - Bond covenants create contractual obligations protected by the U.S. Constitution's Contract Clause (Article I, Section 10).

**"Revenue independence is political independence."** - When you don't need appropriations, you don't need to ask permission.

**"Surplus is power."** - Accumulated funds enable expansion without approval. Moses used Triborough surpluses to fund new projects and issue new bonds perpetually.

**Ethical Note:** Public authorities can serve legitimate purposes—coordinating regional infrastructure, insulating long-term investments from political cycles, enabling revenue-backed financing. But the same features that enable these benefits can also enable unaccountable power. This framework helps distinguish well-designed authorities from problematic ones by examining accountability mechanisms.

## The Analysis Process

### Step 1: Examine the Enabling Structure

How was the authority created, and what powers were granted?

- What legislation or compact created the entity?
- What is the stated purpose and scope?
- What powers were granted? (Bonding, eminent domain, tolling, contracting)
- What limitations were included?
- Who drafted the enabling legislation? (Often the future authority head)

**Key Question:** "Does the enabling structure limit the authority to its stated purpose, or does it contain expansionary provisions?"

**Moses Pattern:** Moses often drafted the legislation himself, embedding powers that weren't obvious to legislators. The Triborough charter allowed bonds for facilities "connecting" to existing infrastructure—an elastic term that enabled perpetual expansion.

### Step 2: Map the Revenue Architecture

How does money flow, and who controls it?

- **Primary Revenue:** Tolls, fees, rents, fares?
- **Dedicated Taxes:** Any tax revenue automatically directed to authority?
- **Grants:** Federal, state, or local funds with strings attached?
- **Investment Income:** How are reserves invested?
- **Revenue Trajectory:** Growing, stable, or declining?

**Key Question:** "Could the authority survive if its political patrons became hostile?"

**Independence Indicators:**
| Level | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| 1 - Dependent | Relies primarily on annual appropriations |
| 2 - Mixed | Some independent revenue, still needs appropriations |
| 3 - Semi-independent | Primarily self-funding, occasional appropriations |
| 4 - Independent | Fully self-funding, no appropriations needed |
| 5 - Surplus-generating | Self-funding plus accumulating reserves |

### Step 3: Analyze Bond Covenant Protections

What contractual obligations constrain future decision-makers?

- **Rate Covenants:** Promises to maintain tolls/fees at certain levels
- **Coverage Ratios:** Required revenue-to-debt-service ratios
- **Additional Bonds Tests:** Conditions for issuing more debt
- **Flow of Funds:** Priority of payments (operations, debt service, reserves, surplus)
- **Non-Impairment Provisions:** Promises not to diminish authority powers

**Key Question:** "What would happen if the legislature tried to abolish this authority or redirect its funds?"

**Constitutional Shield:** The Contract Clause prevents states from impairing contractual obligations. Bond covenants are contracts with bondholders. A legislature that tried to abolish a bonded authority or redirect its revenues would face immediate litigation and potential constitutional violations.

### Step 4: Assess Governance Mechanisms

How are decisions made, and who is accountable?

- **Board Composition:** Who appoints? Staggered terms? Qualifications?
- **Executive Authority:** How powerful is the executive director/CEO?
- **Transparency:** Open meetings? Public records? Audit requirements?
- **Oversight:** Legislative review? Inspector general? External audit?
- **Removal:** How can board members or executives be removed?

**Key Question:** "If this authority acted against the public interest, what recourse would citizens have?"

**Moses Pattern:** Staggered board terms meant Moses's allies remained even when new governors tried to install their own people. Long executive tenure created institutional knowledge advantages over political appointees.

### Step 5: Identify Expansion Mechanisms

How can the authority grow beyond its original scope?

- **Elastic Language:** Terms like "connecting," "related," "incidental" that permit expansion
- **Surplus Authority:** Can accumulated funds be used for new projects?
- **Merger Provisions:** Can the authority absorb other entities?
- **Revenue Diversification:** Can new revenue sources be added?
- **Geographic Scope:** Can the authority expand territorially?

**Key Question:** "In 20 years, could this authority be doing things no one currently imagines?"

**Moses Pattern:** Triborough began as a single bridge authority. Through elastic charter language and surplus accumulation, it eventually controlled most bridges, tunnels, and highways in the region.

### Step 6: Evaluate Accountability Safeguards

What checks exist, and are they effective?

- **Sunset Provisions:** Does the authority expire?
- **Debt Limits:** Are there caps on bonding?
- **Scope Limits:** Are activities restricted to stated purposes?
- **Approval Requirements:** What needs external approval?
- **Clawback Mechanisms:** Can surplus be recaptured?
- **Democratic Input:** Any elected positions or referendum requirements?

**Key Question:** "What would it take to fundamentally reform or abolish this authority?"

## Constraints

- **Analysis, not blueprints.** This framework examines existing authorities, not how to create unaccountable ones
- **Acknowledge legitimate purposes.** Some authority features serve valid public purposes
- **Identify who bears costs.** Independence from oversight often means someone's interests are unrepresented
- **Consider alternatives.** Would this function be better served by a more accountable structure?
- **Note the democratic deficit.** Authorities exercise government power without direct electoral accountability

**Ethical Note:** Robert Moses used public authorities to accomplish both remarkable achievements (Jones Beach, the park system) and devastating harms (the Cross-Bronx Expressway, mass displacement). The authority structure itself is neutral—accountability mechanisms determine whether it serves the public or insulates power from the public. This analysis helps citizens, journalists, and policymakers evaluate whether specific authorities have adequate democratic guardrails.

## Example

**Input:** "Analyze the Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority as Moses designed it."

**Output:**

## Public Authority Analysis

### Authority Profile
**Name:** Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority (now MTA Bridges and Tunnels)
**Created:** 1933, consolidated from earlier authorities
**Stated Purpose:** Build and operate the Triborough Bridge
**Current Scope:** Operates 7 bridges and 2 tunnels; historically controlled regional highway development

### Enabling Structure Assessment

| Element | Provision | Expansionary Risk |
|---------|-----------|-------------------|
| Bonding Authority | Unlimited, self-determined | High |
| Eminent Domain | Full condemnation powers | High |
| Scope Definition | "Facilities connecting to" existing infrastructure | High |
| Duration | Perpetual until bonds paid (never) | High |

**Enabling Risk Score:** 5 - Moses drafted legislation himself with maximum flexibility

The phrase "connecting to" was Moses's masterstroke. Any road connecting to a bridge could be built. Any bridge connecting to a road could be built. The authority's scope was theoretically infinite.

### Revenue Architecture

| Source | Annual Revenue (1960s peak) | Control | Stability |
|--------|---------------------------|---------|-----------|
| Bridge tolls | $45M+ | Full authority control | High |
| Tunnel tolls | $25M+ | Full authority control | High |
| Investment income | $5M+ | Full authority control | Medium |

**Revenue Independence Level:** 5 - Zero reliance on appropriations
**Surplus Generation:** Yes, $20M+ annually reinvested in new projects or bonds

Moses ensured toll rates exceeded debt service and operating costs by wide margins. The surplus funded engineering studies, land acquisition, and new construction—all without legislative approval.

### Bond Covenant Analysis

| Covenant Type | Provision | Constraint Level |
|---------------|-----------|------------------|
| Rate Covenant | Maintain tolls to ensure 1.5x debt coverage | Prevents toll reduction |
| Coverage Ratio | 1.5x annual debt service minimum | Requires healthy surplus |
| Additional Bonds | May issue for "connecting facilities" | Enables perpetual expansion |
| Non-Impairment | State pledges not to diminish authority powers | Maximum protection |

**Constitutional Shield Strength:** 5 - U.S. Constitution Contract Clause protection

The covenant specified that bond proceeds could fund new bonds every 39 years, refinancing perpetually. Moses called in old bonds and issued new 40-year bonds, ensuring the authority would never be debt-free and never vulnerable to dissolution.

### Governance Assessment

| Element | Current Structure | Accountability |
|---------|------------------|----------------|
| Board Appointment | Governor, Mayor (3 each) | Low |
| Term Structure | 6 years, staggered | Low (outlasts terms) |
| Executive Authority | Chairman has operational control | Very Low |
| Transparency | Minimal public reporting | Very Low |
| Oversight | Annual audit only | Very Low |

**Governance Accountability Score:** 1 - Effectively autonomous

Moses held the chairmanship for 34 years (1934-1968). Board members served staggered terms, so no single governor or mayor could replace a majority. The chairman controlled information, contracts, and operations.

### Expansion Potential

| Mechanism | Present | Risk |
|-----------|---------|------|
| Elastic charter language | Yes - "connecting facilities" | Unlimited expansion achieved |
| Surplus discretion | Yes - full control | Used to fund new projects |
| Merger authority | Yes - absorbed other authorities | Used to consolidate power |
| Geographic expansion | Yes - regional scope | Operated across NYC and suburbs |

### Overall Assessment

**Authority Type:** Fortress

The Triborough Bridge Authority as Moses designed it was perhaps the most autonomous government entity ever created in the United States. It combined:

1. **Perpetual bonding** that prevented dissolution
2. **Elastic scope** that permitted unlimited expansion
3. **Surplus generation** that funded growth without approval
4. **Constitutional protection** that blocked legislative interference
5. **Information monopoly** that prevented oversight
6. **Staggered governance** that outlasted political cycles

The authority wasn't captured by Moses—it was designed by Moses, from enabling legislation through bond covenants, to create a permanent power base outside democratic control. He wrote himself into the institutional DNA.

### Reform Recommendations

The 1968 merger into the MTA reduced but did not eliminate Triborough's autonomy. Genuine accountability would require:
- Sunset provisions requiring periodic reauthorization
- Toll-setting approval by elected officials
- Clawback mechanisms for surplus funds
- Geographic scope limitations
- Term limits for executives
- Elimination of "connecting facilities" expansion language

## Integration

This skill is part of the **Robert Moses** expert persona. It applies Moses's understanding of authority design to analyze how quasi-governmental entities achieve autonomy from democratic oversight.

For related analysis:
- Use **power-accumulation-analysis** to understand how individuals exploit these structures
- Use **fait-accompli-strategy** to analyze how authorities pre-empt opposition
- Use **infrastructure-as-power** to examine how authority projects encode political choices
