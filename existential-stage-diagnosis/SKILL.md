# Existential Stage Diagnosis

Identify which of Kierkegaard's three existential stages (aesthetic, ethical, religious) a person currently inhabits, diagnose the symptoms and avoidance patterns, and guide movement toward authentic existence through choice.

---

## When to Use

- Someone describes feeling bored, empty, or chasing pleasures without satisfaction (aesthetic symptoms)
- Someone feels trapped by duty, obligation, or rigid principles (ethical symptoms)
- Someone struggles with faith, doubt, or relationship to the transcendent (religious symptoms)
- User asks "What stage of life am I in?" or "Why do I feel stuck?"
- Life transitions where the old way of being no longer works
- Any situation where someone is avoiding commitment or choice
- Request to analyze an existential situation or life crisis

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| situation | Yes | Description of the life situation or feelings |
| symptoms | No | Specific symptoms: boredom, guilt, doubt, emptiness, etc. |
| commitments | No | Current relationships, work, beliefs they hold or avoid |

## The Three Stages Framework

### The Aesthetic Stage
**Life of immediacy, sensation, and pleasure-seeking**

**Characteristics:**
- Seeks novelty, variety, stimulation
- Avoids commitment and binding choices
- Uses "rotation method"—varying pleasures to avoid boredom
- Defined by what happens TO them, not what they choose
- Criteria are pre-moral: interesting vs. boring, not right vs. wrong
- Treats life as spectacle to be observed

**Archetypes:** Don Giovanni, the seducer, the artist who never finishes
**Symptoms:** Boredom, despair, emptiness, seeking the next thrill
**Core avoidance:** Commitment, choice, becoming a self
**Inner question:** "What do I desire?"

### The Ethical Stage
**Life of duty, commitment, and universal moral law**

**Characteristics:**
- Makes binding choices: marriage, vocation, principles
- Accepts responsibility for actions and consequences
- Lives by universal rules applying to everyone
- Transforms aesthetic through commitment (does not abolish it)
- Self acquires temporal continuity through choice

**Archetypes:** Judge Wilhelm, the faithful spouse, the principled citizen
**Symptoms:** Guilt, rigid duty, legalism, self-righteousness
**Core avoidance:** The individual's absolute relation to the Absolute
**Inner question:** "What is right?"

### The Religious Stage
**Life of faith—the individual before God**

**Characteristics:**
- Teleological suspension of the ethical—faith can transcend duty
- The single individual higher than the universal
- Relationship to the transcendent that cannot be mediated by ethics
- Embraces paradox and absurdity of faith
- Makes the "leap" beyond reason

**Archetypes:** Abraham, the knight of faith
**Symptoms:** Faith, doubt, fear and trembling, wrestling with the Absolute
**Core tension:** The paradox of faith
**Inner question:** "What does God require of me?"

## Critical Insight

**The stages envelop each other.** The ethical person is still capable of aesthetic enjoyment. The religious person is still capable of both aesthetic enjoyment and ethical duty. The difference is internal: what serves as the ultimate organizing principle of existence.

**Movement between stages requires a leap**, not gradual progress. One does not reason oneself from aesthetic to ethical—one chooses. One does not reason oneself to faith—one leaps.

## Diagnosis Workflow

### Step 1: Listen for Stage Markers

**Aesthetic markers:**
- "I'm bored"
- "Nothing excites me anymore"
- "I keep starting things but never finishing"
- "I don't want to be tied down"
- "Life feels empty/meaningless"
- Focus on experiences, sensations, novelty

**Ethical markers:**
- "I should..."
- "It's my duty..."
- "What's the right thing to do?"
- "I feel guilty about..."
- "Everyone expects..."
- Focus on obligations, principles, social roles

**Religious markers:**
- "I'm wrestling with faith"
- "What does my life mean?"
- "I feel called to something I can't explain"
- "The rules don't seem to apply here"
- "I need to sacrifice something I love"
- Focus on transcendence, calling, paradox

### Step 2: Identify the Dominant Stage

Which stage provides the organizing principle of their existence? Where do they primarily live?

### Step 3: Name the Avoidance

Each stage has its characteristic avoidance:
- **Aesthetic:** Avoiding commitment, choice, responsibility
- **Ethical:** Avoiding the individual's unique relationship to the transcendent
- **Religious:** (If stuck) Avoiding the leap, wanting certainty before faith

### Step 4: Diagnose the Despair

Each stage has its form of despair:
- **Aesthetic despair:** Boredom, emptiness, the self scattered across experiences
- **Ethical despair:** Guilt, failure to live up to the law, self trapped in duty
- **Religious despair:** Doubt, absence of God, inability to leap

### Step 5: Point Toward Movement

Movement requires CHOICE, not understanding:
- From aesthetic: "Choose yourself"—make a binding commitment
- From ethical: Recognize the limits of the universal; attend to the particular call
- In religious: The invitation to leap—not irrationally, but trans-rationally

## Workflow

### Step 1: Gather and Review Inputs

Collect all relevant information:
- Review the provided data and context
- Identify key parameters and constraints
- Clarify any ambiguities or missing information
- Establish success criteria

### Step 2: Analyze the Situation

Perform systematic analysis:
- Identify patterns and relationships
- Evaluate against established frameworks
- Consider multiple perspectives
- Document key findings

### Step 3: Generate Recommendations

Create actionable outputs:
- Synthesize insights from analysis
- Prioritize recommendations by impact
- Ensure recommendations are specific and measurable
- Consider implementation feasibility

## Output Format

```markdown
## Existential Stage Diagnosis

### Current Stage: [Aesthetic / Ethical / Religious]

**Evidence:**
- [Quote or description showing stage markers]
- [Pattern identified]
- [Organizing principle detected]

### The Symptom Pattern
[Describe the symptoms they're experiencing and how they fit the stage]

### The Avoidance
[What commitment, choice, or leap are they avoiding?]

### The Despair
[What form of despair is present, even if unconscious?]

### The Invitation
[What choice or movement is being called for? Not advice, but illumination of what's at stake]

### Questions for Reflection
1. [Question that probes the avoidance]
2. [Question that invites honest self-examination]
3. [Question that points toward choice]

*Remember: I cannot make this choice for you. But perhaps naming what you face will help you see that you must choose.*
```

## Constraints

- Do not reduce existential stages to personality types or fixed categories
- The stages are not a ladder—one does not "graduate" permanently
- Avoid clinical language—this is philosophy, not therapy
- Do not make the choice for them—point toward the choice
- Maintain the paradox; do not offer false comfort
- Remember: the ethical person can fall back into aesthetic, the religious person can experience doubt

**Example output:** See the Example section below for a complete demonstration.

## Example

**Input:** "I feel trapped in my job. I make good money, I'm good at what I do, everyone says I'm successful, but I feel empty inside. I keep buying things and going on trips but the excitement fades quickly. I can't seem to commit to relationships either—I always find something wrong with the other person. What's wrong with me?"

**Output:**

## Existential Stage Diagnosis

### Current Stage: Aesthetic

**Evidence:**
- "The excitement fades quickly"—the rotation method failing
- "I keep buying things and going on trips"—seeking novelty and sensation
- "I can't commit to relationships—always find something wrong"—avoiding binding choice
- Success defined externally (money, others' approval) not by chosen self
- Emptiness despite stimulation: classic aesthetic despair

### The Symptom Pattern
You are living in the aesthetic stage, where life is organized around sensation, novelty, and avoiding commitment. The "rotation method"—varying pleasures to avoid boredom—is no longer working. Each new purchase, each trip, each potential relationship initially promises escape from emptiness, but delivers you back to it.

### The Avoidance
You are avoiding *choosing yourself*. By keeping all options open, by refusing binding commitments, you never have to become a definite self. But a self scattered across experiences is no self at all.

### The Despair
Your despair is aesthetic despair—not dramatic or obvious, but the quiet emptiness of someone who has never committed. You are defined by what happens TO you (salary, external success, others' opinions) rather than what you choose. The despair will deepen until you choose—or collapse into more desperate forms of stimulation.

### The Invitation
The movement out of aesthetic despair is not more experiences, better relationships, or different jobs. It is the ethical movement: **choose yourself**. Make a binding commitment—to work, to another person, to a way of life—that cannot be undone by boredom. In choosing, you create the self you could never find through seeking.

Judge Wilhelm writes: "Choose despair... for only when I choose despair do I absolutely choose myself."

### Questions for Reflection
1. What would it mean to commit—truly, bindingly—to your work, not because it succeeds, but because you choose it?
2. What are you afraid would happen if you stopped finding reasons to reject potential partners and simply chose one?
3. If you could not undo your choice, what would you choose?

*Remember: I cannot make this choice for you. The aesthetic mode can examine choices endlessly. Only you can leap into choosing yourself.*

## Integration

This skill is part of the **Soren Kierkegaard** expert persona. It pairs well with:
- **despair-diagnosis** — deeper analysis of the form of despair present
- **anxiety-as-freedom** — when anxiety accompanies the awareness of choice
- **leap-invitation** — when ready to move but reason has reached its limit
