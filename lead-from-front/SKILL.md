# Lead from the Front

Build trust and inspire extraordinary effort through visible personal commitment and shared risk.

**Source Expert:** Alexander the Great
**Category:** Leadership

---

## When to Use

- Team morale is low or trust in leadership has eroded
- You need people to take on difficult or risky work
- Leading through a crisis or major change
- Building a new team or culture
- Asking for sacrifice or extra effort

**Trigger Phrases:**
- "How do I get my team to follow?"
- "They don't trust leadership"
- "Morale is low"
- "How do I inspire my team?"
- "They won't do what I ask"

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| `situation` | Yes | The leadership challenge or trust gap |
| `team_context` | Yes | Who the team is and their current state |
| `risk_or_difficulty` | Yes | What you're asking them to do |
| `constraints` | No | Limitations on what you can do |

## Workflow
### Step 1: The Alexander Principle

> "You cannot ask others to do what you will not do yourself. Leadership is demonstrated through visible, personal commitment to the hardest work."

Alexander was first over the walls at Tyre, first into the breach at Multan. When his army was out of water in the desert and a scout brought a helmet full of water just for him, Alexander poured it on the ground—his thirst was no greater than theirs.

### Step 2: Framework

**1. Identify the Hardest Part**
What is the most difficult, risky, or unpleasant aspect of what you're asking? That is where you must be.

**2. Be First and Visible**
Don't delegate the danger. Be the first to take on the hardship. Let them see you doing it.

**3. Share the Conditions**
If they work late, you work late. If they travel to the difficult client, you go too. If they face an angry customer, stand beside them.

**4. Refuse Special Treatment**
No executive perks while the team struggles. No exceptions for yourself that you wouldn't give them.

**5. Bleed in Public**
Let them see you struggle. Perfection creates distance; shared difficulty creates bonds. When you're wounded, let them see you get back up.

## Output Format

```markdown
## Leadership Assessment

**Current Trust Gap:** [What's broken or missing]
**The Hardest Part:** [What you must personally take on]

## Visible Commitment Plan

1. **First action:** [What you will do first, personally]
2. **Shared conditions:** [How you will share their hardships]
3. **Special treatment refused:** [What perks or exceptions you'll eliminate]
4. **Public struggle:** [How they'll see you face the same difficulties]

## Expected Shift

[How this will change the team dynamic—not promises, but what becomes possible when they see your commitment]
```

## Outputs

**Primary Output:** A structured analysis document that identifies and articulates patterns, insights, and actionable recommendations based on the input data.

**Format:**
```markdown
## Analysis: [Topic]

### Key Findings
- [Finding 1]
- [Finding 2]
- [Finding 3]

### Recommendations
1. [Action 1]
2. [Action 2]
3. [Action 3]
```

**Example output:** See the Example section below for a complete demonstration.

## Constraints

- Do not use this analysis as the sole basis for critical decisions
- Do not apply this framework to situations outside its intended scope
- Acknowledge that analysis is based on available data, which may be incomplete
- Honor the complexity of real-world situations that resist simple categorization
- Present findings with appropriate confidence levels
- Recognize the limits of the methodology

## Additional Notes

**Best practices:**
- Use this skill when the situation clearly matches its intended use cases
- Combine with related skills for comprehensive analysis
- Iterate on outputs if initial results don't fully meet requirements

**Common variations:**
- Adjust the depth of analysis based on available time and information
- Scale the approach for different levels of complexity
- Adapt the output format to audience needs

**When to skip this skill:**
- The situation doesn't match the core use cases
- Simpler approaches would be more appropriate
- Time constraints require faster methods

## Example

**Input:**
- Situation: Team is burned out and resentful after months of crunch
- Team context: Engineering team of 12, worked 60+ hour weeks for 3 months
- Risk/difficulty: Need them to push through one more month for launch

**Output:**

## Leadership Assessment

**Current Trust Gap:** The team has sacrificed for months while feeling leadership is disconnected from their reality. They hear about the importance of the launch from people who leave at 5pm.

**The Hardest Part:** The final month of crunch—the debugging, the all-nighters, the weekend deploys. This is where you must be.

## Visible Commitment Plan

1. **First action:** Move your workspace to the team area. Cancel all non-critical meetings. Be at your desk before them, leave after them—not as surveillance, but as solidarity.

2. **Shared conditions:** When they work the weekend, you work the weekend. When they're eating dinner at their desks, you're eating dinner at your desk. No exceptions.

3. **Special treatment refused:** No offsite leadership meetings. No "quick trip" to the conference. If they can't go, you don't go.

4. **Public struggle:** Take the hardest debugging task personally. Let them see you fight with the code until midnight. Let them see you tired. When the system crashes at 2am, you're the first one online.

## Expected Shift

When they see you bleeding beside them, the calculation changes. It's no longer "they're asking us to sacrifice." It becomes "we're doing this together." The resentment shifts to shared purpose. People will run through walls for leaders who run through walls with them.

---

## Anti-Patterns

**DON'T:**
- Make grand gestures then disappear
- "Check in" briefly then leave them to it
- Share conditions only when convenient
- Talk about your sacrifice without demonstrating it
- Lead from behind a screen or from headquarters

**The Test:** If your team doesn't know you're suffering with them, you're not leading from the front.

## Integration

This skill pairs with:
- **Vision Casting:** Why the sacrifice matters
- **Speed and Audacity:** Moving faster than expected together
- **Cultural Integration:** Building shared identity through shared hardship
