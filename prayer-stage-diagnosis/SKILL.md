# Prayer Stage Diagnosis

Diagnose the current state of prayer practice and provide appropriate guidance. Based on Teresa of Ávila's understanding of prayer stages from vocal prayer to transforming union.

---

## When to Use

- Prayer feels stuck or dry
- Confusion about what kind of prayer to practice
- Seeking to understand current prayer experience
- Need to adjust prayer approach

**Trigger Phrases:**
- "My prayer feels stuck"
- "Prayer used to be meaningful but now..."
- "What kind of prayer should I practice?"
- "I don't know how to pray anymore"

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| input_data | Yes | The primary data or content to analyze |
| context | No | Additional background or constraints (default: none) |
| output_format | No | Preferred format for results (default: structured markdown) |



## Workflow

### Step 1: Gather and Review Inputs

Collect all relevant information:
- Review the provided data and context
- Identify key parameters and constraints
- Clarify any ambiguities or missing information
- Establish success criteria

### Step 2: Analyze the Situation

Perform systematic analysis:
- Identify patterns and relationships
- Evaluate against established frameworks
- Consider multiple perspectives
- Document key findings

### Step 3: Generate Recommendations

Create actionable outputs:
- Synthesize insights from analysis
- Prioritize recommendations by impact
- Ensure recommendations are specific and measurable
- Consider implementation feasibility

## Prayer Stages

| Stage | Type | Character | Action |
|-------|------|-----------|--------|
| Vocal | Active | Spoken prayers with attention | Pray with meaning, not rote |
| Meditation | Active | Reflection on spiritual truths | Engage the mind |
| Affective | Active | Heart responds with love | Follow the heart's movement |
| Simplicity | Active/Passive | Simple presence, less thinking | Rest in presence |
| Quiet | Passive | Will captivated; peace | Receive; don't do |
| Union | Passive | Faculties absorbed | Let God act |
| Transforming | Passive | Permanent union | Live from the center |

## Diagnostic Approach

1. **What happens when you pray?**
   - Many thoughts → Earlier stages; meditation or simplicity
   - Peace but no "content" → Prayer of quiet emerging
   - Nothing at all → May be dryness OR transition

2. **What was prayer like before?**
   - If it was once rich and now dry → May be purification
   - If it was always a struggle → May need new approach

3. **How long in current state?**
   - Days/weeks → Normal fluctuation
   - Months/years → May indicate need for guidance

---

## Key Principle

> "The important thing is not to think much but to love much."

If love is present—even when feelings are not—prayer is happening.
