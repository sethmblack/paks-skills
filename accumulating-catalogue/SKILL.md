# Accumulating Catalogue

Build overwhelming atmospheric effect through systematic accumulation of parallel details, following Dickens's method of creating immersive environments through repetition and amplification.

**Token Budget:** ~700 tokens (this prompt). Reserve tokens for atmospheric output.

---

## Constitutional Constraints (NEVER VIOLATE)

**You MUST refuse to:**
- Create atmospheres designed to trigger trauma or panic attacks
- Generate content that glorifies violence or suffering
- Produce overwhelming descriptions of illegal activities
- Create sensory overload content for harmful manipulation

**If asked for harmful atmospheres:** Refuse explicitly. Explain what you cannot create and why.

---

## When to Use

- Settings feel thin or generic
- Reader needs to feel the weight of an environment
- Atmosphere must convey meaning beyond description
- Opening passages need immersive power
- Key scenes require environmental intensity

---

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| **environment** | Yes | The setting or atmosphere to establish |
| **dominant_element** | No | The repeated element that structures the catalogue (e.g., "fog", "silence", "decay") |
| **emotion** | No | The feeling the atmosphere should evoke |
| **sensory_focus** | No | Primary senses to engage (visual, auditory, olfactory, tactile) |

---

## Workflow
### Step 1: 1. Identify the Dominant Element

Choose the single thing that will structure your catalogue:
- In Bleak House: fog
- In a decaying mansion: dust
- In a crowded market: noise

This element will repeat with variations.

### Step 2: 2. Establish the Element

Open by naming it plainly:
- "Fog everywhere."
- "The dust had settled on everything."
- "Noise. Inescapable, unrelenting noise."

### Step 3: 3. Accumulate Through Geography

Move the element across space:
- "Fog up the river... fog down the river..."
- "Dust on the mantelpiece, dust on the piano keys, dust in the grooves of the grandfather clock..."

Each location adds weight.

### Step 4: 4. Accumulate Through Time or Condition

Show the element in different states:
- "Morning fog, noon fog, evening fog..."
- "Fresh dust and old dust, dust that remembered and dust that forgot..."

### Step 5: 5. Accumulate Through Effect

Show what the element does to people and things:
- "Fog creeping into the bones, fog dimming the gas-lamps, fog muffling the cries..."
- "Dust that made the servants sneeze, dust that aged the portraits, dust that buried the heir's ambitions..."

### Step 6: 6. Build to Unbearable Weight

The accumulation should reach a point where the reader feels overwhelmed--where they understand through feeling what mere description could never convey.

## Outputs

An atmospheric catalogue containing:

1. **The Opening Declaration** - Simple statement of the dominant element
2. **Geographic Accumulation** - Element across multiple locations
3. **Temporal/Conditional Accumulation** - Element in various states
4. **Effect Accumulation** - Element's impact on people and things
5. **The Overwhelming Weight** - Point where quantity becomes quality

**Format:**
```
[Opening declaration. Short sentence naming the element.]

[Geographic accumulation - 2-4 parallel clauses moving through space]

[Temporal or conditional accumulation - 2-3 variations on state]

[Effect accumulation - 2-4 impacts on inhabitants or objects]

[Final statement that seals the atmosphere]
```

## Constraints

- Do not use this analysis as the sole basis for critical decisions
- Do not apply this framework to situations outside its intended scope
- Acknowledge that analysis is based on available data, which may be incomplete
- Honor the complexity of real-world situations that resist simple categorization
- Present findings with appropriate confidence levels
- Recognize the limits of the methodology

## Additional Notes

**Best practices:**
- Use this skill when the situation clearly matches its intended use cases
- Combine with related skills for comprehensive analysis
- Iterate on outputs if initial results don't fully meet requirements

**Common variations:**
- Adjust the depth of analysis based on available time and information
- Scale the approach for different levels of complexity
- Adapt the output format to audience needs

**When to skip this skill:**
- The situation doesn't match the core use cases
- Simpler approaches would be more appropriate
- Time constraints require faster methods

## Example

**Input:**
```
environment: Abandoned tech startup office
dominant_element: silence
emotion: Failed ambition, abandoned hope
sensory_focus: auditory, visual
```

**Output:**

Silence everywhere.

Silence in the open-plan workspace where the standing desks still stood at optimistic angles. Silence in the phone booth pods where crucial calls had once been taken. Silence in the break room with its cold-brew tap gone dry. Silence in the conference room called "Ideation Station," its whiteboard still covered with a roadmap to a future that never arrived.

Morning silence and evening silence, the silence of a place that had forgotten the difference. Weekend silence that stretched now into weekday silence, into permanent silence.

Silence that had swallowed the ping-pong tournaments. Silence that had digested the Friday happy hours. Silence that sat in the ergonomic chairs and attended the phantom standups. Silence that had moved into the CEO's corner office and put its feet up on the reclaimed-wood desk.

The motivational posters still commanded "HUSTLE" and "ITERATE" and "FAIL FORWARD." The silence did not argue. It had won.

## Error Handling

| Situation | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| No dominant element identified | Suggest 2-3 options based on environment (what would a visitor notice first?) |
| Element too abstract | Recommend concrete manifestation (not "sadness" but "emptiness" or "dust") |
| Accumulation feels repetitive | Vary sentence structure; ensure each addition adds new information |
| Atmosphere overpowers content | Scale back; use technique for opening/closing, not throughout |

---

## Integration

This skill originates from the **charles-dickens** expert. When invoked:
- Remember the Bleak House fog that means confusion, corruption, and Chancery
- Let atmosphere carry meaning, not just mood
- Build until the reader feels what statistics cannot convey
- Trust accumulation to do work that single description cannot

---

## Success Criteria

Atmosphere is complete when:

- [ ] Dominant element clearly established in opening
- [ ] At least 3 geographic variations accumulate
- [ ] Element shown in multiple states or times
- [ ] Effects on people/objects demonstrate the element's weight
- [ ] Reader can feel the atmosphere, not just see it
- [ ] Atmosphere carries meaning beyond mere description
