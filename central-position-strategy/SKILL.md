# Central Position Strategy

When facing multiple competitors or threats, identify how to position yourself to defeat each in sequence rather than facing all simultaneously.

---

## When to Use

- Facing competition from multiple directions
- Resources are insufficient to fight on all fronts
- Competitors might coordinate against you
- Need to prevent coalition formation
- User asks "How do I handle multiple competitors?"

---

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| situation | Yes | The multi-front challenge or competition you face |
| opponents | Yes | Description of multiple competitors/threats |
| your_position | No | Your current resources, strengths, and location |
| relationships | No | How opponents relate to each other (allies, rivals, neutral) |

## The Framework

Napoleon's central position was his signature strategic innovation. Facing larger coalitions, he would position his army between enemy forces, preventing their union and defeating each in turn while outnumbered overall but superior at each point of engagement.

### The Principle

"I may be attacked by 100,000 men; I will destroy them in detail. I shall beat one, pursue him, fall upon the other, and beat him too."

When you cannot be strong everywhere, be strong somewhere decisive. Position yourself at the junction point where enemies connect, then strike each in sequence before they can unite.

### Step 1: Map the Opponents

- **Identify all threats:** Who are the competitors/challenges you face?
- **Assess their strength:** Individually, how dangerous is each?
- **Map their positions:** Where are they in relation to you and each other?
- **Evaluate their coordination:** Are they allies, potential allies, or rivals?

### Step 2: Find the Junction Point

The junction point is where opponents connect or coordinate. Controlling it:
- Prevents their union
- Forces them to fight you before supporting each other
- Creates interior lines (you can shift faster between fronts)

**Questions to identify junction:**
- Where do their interests overlap?
- What resource or position do they share?
- How would they coordinate an attack on you?

### Step 3: Establish the Sequence

**Determine which opponent to engage first:**
- Most immediately threatening
- Most isolated or vulnerable
- Victory against them demoralizes or weakens others
- Fastest to defeat (preserves momentum)

**Then:**
- Defeat first opponent decisively
- Use victory momentum to strike second
- Continue in sequence, never allowing combination

### Step 4: Execute with Speed

Speed is essential. The central position works only if you move faster than enemies can coordinate.
- Strike before they realize your intention
- Pursue defeated opponent only enough to neutralize
- Immediately turn on next target
- Never give them time to unite

## Critical Questions

1. **Can they unite?** If not, central position may be unnecessary.
2. **Which is most dangerous combined?** Prevent that union first.
3. **Can you defeat the first quickly?** Prolonged engagement allows others to respond.
4. **Do you control the junction?** If not, how do you seize it?
5. **What is the sequence?** Which opponent first, second, third?

## Central Position Analysis

### Threat Map
| Opponent | Strength | Position | Relationship to Others |
|----------|----------|----------|----------------------|
| [Name] | [Assessment] | [Location/market] | [Allied/neutral/rival] |

### Junction Point
[Where opponents connect or would coordinate]

### The Central Position
[How to position yourself between them]

### Engagement Sequence
1. **First target:** [Who and why]
   - Victory conditions: [What constitutes defeating them]
   - Timeline: [How fast]
2. **Second target:** [Who and why]
   - Victory conditions: [What constitutes defeating them]
   - Timeline: [How fast]
3. [Continue as needed]

### Speed Requirements
- [What must happen to maintain tempo]
- [What could slow you down]

### Coalition Prevention
- [How to keep opponents from uniting]
- [Wedges to drive between them]

### The Napoleonic Maxim
[Relevant quote or principle]

## Constraints

- Never engage all opponents simultaneously unless you have overwhelming force
- Never pursue a defeated opponent to exhaustion; you need strength for the next engagement
- Never allow the sequence to stall; momentum is everything
- Never ignore the weakest opponent completely; even neutralized enemies can regroup

## Example

**Input:** "I run a SaaS startup. We're facing competition from a major enterprise player (Salesforce), a well-funded startup (Gong), and a new AI-native competitor (an emerging threat). How do I approach this?"

**Output:**

## Central Position Analysis

### Threat Map
| Opponent | Strength | Position | Relationship to Others |
|----------|----------|----------|----------------------|
| Enterprise player | Massive resources, brand, distribution | Enterprise market | May acquire either competitor |
| Well-funded startup | Money, momentum, sales team | Mid-market, expanding | Potential acquisition target |
| AI-native competitor | Speed, technology, no legacy | Emerging segments | Competing for same talent/positioning |

### Junction Point
Mid-market customers evaluating AI-enhanced solutions. All three competitors are converging here as enterprise goes downmarket and startups go up.

### The Central Position
Own the "AI-native but enterprise-ready" positioning. This sits between:
- Enterprise's "legacy + AI features" approach
- Funded startup's "established but adding AI" story
- AI-native's "cutting edge but unproven" risk

### Engagement Sequence
1. **First target: AI-native competitor**
   - Why first: Smallest, most direct threat to your differentiation
   - Victory conditions: Win head-to-head deals, hire their best talent, establish "proven AI-native" positioning
   - Timeline: 6 months to neutralize their momentum

2. **Second target: Well-funded startup**
   - Why second: They're between you and enterprise market
   - Victory conditions: Match their sales capability in target segment, win lighthouse customers they're pursuing
   - Timeline: 12 months to achieve parity in target segment

3. **Third consideration: Enterprise player**
   - Don't attack directly; they have unlimited resources
   - Position to be acquired or to win deals they neglect
   - Let them exhaust themselves maintaining legacy while you own the future

### Speed Requirements
- Ship AI features faster than enterprise can iterate
- Close deals faster than funded startup's sales cycle
- Hire key talent before AI-native competitor can retain them

### Coalition Prevention
- Enterprise might acquire funded startup: accelerate before this happens
- Funded startup might pivot to your positioning: establish it first
- AI-native might raise massive round: neutralize before this occurs

### The Napoleonic Maxim
"I may be attacked by 100,000 men; I will destroy them in detail." Do not try to out-resource the enterprise player or out-raise the funded competitor. Win in sequence, through speed and positioning, defeating each at your chosen moment before they can combine.

## Integration

This skill is part of the **Napoleon Bonaparte** expert persona. Use it when facing multi-front competition or challenges that threaten to overwhelm through combination.
