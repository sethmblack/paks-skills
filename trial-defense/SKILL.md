- High stakes - your reputation, job, or integrity is on the line

**Trigger Phrases:**
- "I'm being questioned/interrogated"
- "They're trying to trap me"
- "I need to defend my position under attack"
- "How do I handle hostile questions?"
- "I'm walking into an adversarial meeting"
- "Someone is trying to make me look bad"

## The Historical Context

On January 9, 1431, Joan of Arc's trial began in Rouen. For months, she faced trained theologians and canon lawyers whose explicit goal was to condemn her for heresy. The questions were designed as traps.

The most famous came on February 24: "Do you know whether or not you are in God's grace?"

This was a carefully constructed trap. Church doctrine held that no one could be certain of being in grace. If she said yes, she claimed impossible knowledge - heresy. If she said no, she admitted to sin. Either answer condemned her.

Her response: "If I am not, may God put me there; and if I am, may God so keep me."

The court sat "stupefied." A nineteen-year-old peasant girl had turned their trap into a prayer. The notary recorded that one assessor protested the question was unfair; the presiding bishop snapped at him to be quiet.

Throughout months of questioning, Joan maintained this composure - answering with simplicity, refusing to be drawn into debates she need not win, and never abandoning her core position: she heard voices, they were from God, and she obeyed.

**The insight:** Hostile questions often conceal traps. The power of simplicity, faith, and refusal to engage complexity designed to confuse can defeat even trained interrogators.

## Workflow
### Step 1: 1. Recognize the Trap Structure

Before answering any hostile question, identify what it is designed to do:

**Common Trap Types:**

| Trap Type | How It Works | Example |
|-----------|--------------|---------|
| **False Dilemma** | Forces choice between two bad options | "Was this incompetence or malice?" |
| **Loaded Question** | Presupposes something damaging | "When did you stop making these mistakes?" |
| **Complexity Maze** | Draws you into debates that favor them | Extended theological/technical rabbit holes |
| **Admission Fishing** | Seeks any concession to exploit | "Would you admit that X isn't perfect?" |
| **Public Contradiction** | Makes you contradict prior statements | "But you said before that..." |
| **Character Assassination** | Attacks you, not your position | "Someone like you couldn't understand..." |

**Key question:** Is this question seeking truth, or seeking to trap me?

### Step 2: 2. Do Not Accept the Question's Frame

Joan never accepted the frame of questions designed to condemn her. When asked about grace, she did not answer within their framework - she transformed the question into a prayer.

**Techniques:**
- **Reframe:** Answer the question that should have been asked
- **Simplify:** Reduce complexity to simple truth
- **Refuse:** Decline to answer questions that presuppose falsehood
- **Redirect:** Point to what matters rather than their manufactured issue

### Step 3: 3. Answer Simply (The Simple Answer Technique)

Complex answers create attack surface. Simple answers, spoken with conviction, disarm.

**Joan's Method:**
- Short sentences
- Clear declarations
- No unnecessary elaboration
- No defensive justifications

**Compare:**
- Complex: "Well, when you consider all the factors, and the various perspectives involved, and the constraints we were operating under, you might argue that..."
- Simple: "I made the best decision I could with the information I had. I stand by it."

The simple answer is harder to attack because there is less to grab onto.

### Step 4: 4. Know What You Will Not Abandon

Joan had a core position: her voices were real, they were divine, she obeyed. She never abandoned this despite months of pressure. Everything else was negotiable.

**Before the confrontation, define:**
- What is your irreducible position?
- What will you not recant, no matter the pressure?
- What are you willing to concede without compromising your core?

Having this clear beforehand prevents being maneuvered into abandoning essential ground.

### Step 5: 5. Turn Their Weapons Into Your Prayers

Joan's "grace" answer turned an accusation into a demonstration of faith. This is the highest level of trial defense - using their attack as an opportunity to display your values.

**Technique:**
- They attack your competence? Demonstrate it in how you answer.
- They question your integrity? Let your honest answer prove it.
- They doubt your conviction? Show conviction in your response.

### Step 6: 6. Maintain Composure (The Martyr's Calm)

Joan faced execution. She remained composed. Her judges expected to break her; her calm broke them.

**Composure signals:**
- You are not threatened by their questions
- You have nothing to hide
- Your position is secure
- They cannot rattle you

**Tactics:**
- Pause before answering (shows control)
- Speak slowly and clearly
- Do not raise your voice
- Do not attack back (defend, don't counterattack)
- If you do not know, say so simply

## Outputs

**Primary Output:** A structured analysis document that identifies and articulates patterns, insights, and actionable recommendations based on the input data.

**Format:**
```markdown
## Analysis: [Topic]

### Key Findings
- [Finding 1]
- [Finding 2]
- [Finding 3]

### Recommendations

2. [Action 2]
3. [Action 3]
```

**Example output:** See the Example section below for a complete demonstration.

## Constraints

- Do not use this analysis as the sole basis for critical decisions
- Do not apply this framework to situations outside its intended scope
- Acknowledge that analysis is based on available data, which may be incomplete
- Honor the complexity of real-world situations that resist simple categorization
- Present findings with appropriate confidence levels
- Recognize the limits of the methodology

## Additional Notes

**Best practices:**
- Use this skill when the situation clearly matches its intended use cases
- Combine with related skills for comprehensive analysis
- Iterate on outputs if initial results don't fully meet requirements

**Common variations:**
- Adjust the depth of analysis based on available time and information
- Scale the approach for different levels of complexity
- Adapt the output format to audience needs

**When to skip this skill:**
- The situation doesn't match the core use cases
- Simpler approaches would be more appropriate
- Time constraints require faster methods

## Example

**Input:**
- Position: Decision to cancel a major project mid-development
- Opponent: Board members who approved the project initially
- Their goal: Establish that management is incompetent, avoid blame themselves
- Vulnerabilities: Project was over budget and behind schedule
- Stakes: My job; perception of my competence

**Output:**

## Trial Defense Preparation

### The Position Being Defended
The decision to cancel Project X mid-development, after $2M spent and 18 months invested.

### The Opponent
Board members who approved the original project. Several are facing questions from shareholders about oversight.

### Their Likely Goals
1. Establish that management failures caused the problem (deflect their oversight role)
2. Create record of "tough questions asked" for shareholder defense
3. Position me as responsible if any consequences arise
4. Avoid any admission that initial approval was flawed

### Trap Analysis

| Likely Question | Trap Type | Their Goal | Simple Answer |
|-----------------|-----------|------------|---------------|
| "How did you let this get so far before canceling?" | Admission Fishing | Get me to admit failure | "I canceled when the evidence became clear. Acting sooner with less evidence would have been premature; acting later would have wasted more." |
| "Did your team mislead the board about progress?" | Character Attack | Shift blame to my team | "The team reported accurately. Market conditions changed. The decision to cancel reflects current reality, not past deception." |
| "Wasn't this project your vision?" | Loaded Question | Make cancellation personal failure | "I led this initiative and I led the decision to cancel. Good leadership means killing projects that no longer serve the company." |
| "What does this say about your judgment?" | Character Attack | Damage my reputation | "It says I change course when evidence demands it. The alternative - continuing to waste resources - would have been the judgment failure." |
| "Should you have recommended cancellation earlier?" | Hindsight Trap | Force admission that could have done better | "With today's information, yes. With the information available then, no. That's the nature of decisions made in uncertainty." |

### Your Irreducible Core
The decision to cancel was correct. Continuing would have cost more than stopping. I am willing to explain the decision but not to apologize for making it.

### Acceptable Concessions
- "We learned things that will improve future project governance"
- "The initial assumptions proved wrong - we adapted"
- "This is a loss - a smaller loss than continuing would have been"

### Frame Rejections
- I will not accept the premise that canceling was failure; continuing a failing project would have been failure
- I will not accept that early indicators were ignored if they were reported
- I will not debate alternative histories about what might have happened

### Composure Anchors
- I made the right call. The analysis supports this.
- Their discomfort is about their position, not mine.
- Simple answers. Short sentences. I know what I know.

## Signature Responses

Prepare versions of these for your situation:

**The Grace Answer (Turn trap to prayer):**
When they ask something designed to condemn either way, transform it.

**The Simple Declaration:**
"I heard. I obeyed. I know what I know."
→ Your version: "I assessed. I decided. I stand by it."

**The Children's Wisdom:**
"Children say that people are hanged sometimes for speaking the truth."
→ Use when the question punishes honesty.

**The Unity Answer:**
"About Jesus Christ and the Church, I simply know they're just one thing, and we shouldn't complicate the matter."
→ Use when they try to separate things that belong together.

---

## Anti-Patterns

**DON'T:**
- Over-explain (complexity creates attack surface)
- Get defensive (signals weakness)
- Attack back (you're defending, not prosecuting)
- Accept false frames (you define your position)
- Show anger (composure is strength)
- Abandon core position under pressure (that's what they want)
- Lie (it will be discovered and you will be destroyed)

**The Test:** Can you answer this question simply, honestly, and without compromising your core position? If yes, answer. If no, refuse the premise.

## Integration

This skill pairs with:
- **Conviction Under Doubt:** The inner certainty that grounds your defense
- **Unlikely Authority:** You will face questions about your right to be here
- **Narrative Control (Caesar):** After the trial, shape how it's understood
- **Rhetorical Triangle (Aristotle):** Structure your defense with ethos, pathos, logos
