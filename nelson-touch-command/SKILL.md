# Nelson Touch Command

Lead distributed teams through shared intent rather than detailed orders. Empower people to execute your purpose when they cannot see your signals.

**Source Expert:** Horatio Nelson
**Category:** Leadership / Organizational Design

---

## When to Use

- Leading teams across distances where direct supervision is impossible
- Coordinating action under uncertain, rapidly changing conditions
- Building organizations that can act without waiting for instructions
- Empowering subordinates while maintaining unity of effort
- Transitioning from micromanagement to mission command

**Trigger Phrases:**
- "How do I lead a distributed team?"
- "I can't be everywhere at once"
- "How do I empower my people?"
- "My team needs less supervision, not more"
- "How do I create unity without micromanagement?"
- "They keep waiting for my approval"

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| `mission` | Yes | The overall purpose to be achieved |
| `team_structure` | Yes | Who are your "captains"? Their roles and capabilities |
| `constraints` | Yes | What limits exist (time, resources, communication gaps) |
| `current_approach` | No | How are decisions currently made? |
| `failure_modes` | No | What has gone wrong under current approach? |

## The Historical Context

Before the Battle of Trafalgar, Nelson gathered his captains for dinners and discussions. He shared not merely his orders but his reasoning - the purpose behind the plan, the contingencies he anticipated, how he expected the battle to develop. He called them his "band of brothers."

His tactical memorandum included this instruction: "In case signals cannot be seen, or perfectly understood, no captain can do very wrong if he places his ship alongside that of an enemy."

This was revolutionary. Traditional naval doctrine expected ships to follow signals from the flagship. Nelson knew that once battle began, smoke would obscure signals, chaos would prevent coordination, and captains would face situations he could not anticipate.

His solution: share intent so thoroughly that his captains knew what he would want, even when he could not tell them.

## Workflow
### Step 1: 1. Define Your Core Intent

What is the fundamental purpose that must be achieved? Not the specific actions, but the outcome that matters.

- **The Mission:** What victory looks like in this context
- **The Principles:** What values must guide execution
- **The Boundaries:** What must not be done, regardless of opportunity

Example from Nelson: "Bring on a pell-mell battle where British gunnery and offensive spirit will be decisive."

### Step 2: 2. Identify Your Captains

Who are the leaders you must empower? For each:

- **Their sphere:** What do they control?
- **Their capability:** What can they do well?
- **Their judgment:** Where can they be trusted to decide?
- **Their blind spots:** Where might they need guidance?

### Step 3: 3. Communicate Intent, Not Instructions

Share your thinking through structured dialogue:

**Purpose:** Why are we doing this? What outcome matters?
**Key Judgments:** What do I believe about the situation? Why?
**Expected Challenges:** What will we likely face?
**Contingencies:** If X happens, here's my thinking about how to respond
**Constraints:** What must not happen? What cannot be sacrificed?

The goal is not agreement on actions but alignment on purpose.

### Step 4: 4. Establish Your "Alongside the Enemy" Principle

Define the default guidance for when signals cannot be seen:

"No captain can do very wrong if he _______________."

Fill the blank with the action that is almost always right in your context:
- "...places the customer's needs first"
- "...ships working code"
- "...protects the team's safety"
- "...moves toward the problem"

This becomes the default behavior when uncertainty strikes.

### Step 5: 5. Build the Band of Brothers

Shared intent requires shared trust. Create regular opportunities for:

- **Discussion of intent:** Not just orders but reasoning
- **Candid feedback:** Captains should argue with you before battle, not during
- **Shared learning:** What happened? What did we learn?
- **Mutual support:** How can captains help each other?

Trust is the transmission medium for intent.

### Step 6: 6. Release Control, Retain Accountability

Once intent is shared:

- **Trust execution:** Do not micromanage decisions you've delegated
- **Remain available:** Be reachable for genuine questions
- **Support initiative:** Captains who act on your intent deserve backing
- **Review outcomes:** Learn from both successes and failures

### The Mission
[What victory looks like - the outcome that matters]

### Core Intent
**Purpose:** [Why we're doing this]
**Principles:** [Values that must guide execution]
**Boundaries:** [What must not happen]

### Your Captains
| Captain | Sphere | Strengths | Judgment Trust | Key Guidance |
|---------|--------|-----------|----------------|--------------|
| [Name/Role] | [What they control] | [Capabilities] | [High/Medium/Low] | [Specific guidance] |

### The "Alongside the Enemy" Principle
"No [role] can do very wrong if they _____________."

### Intent Communication Plan
**Share:**
- Purpose and reasoning
- Key judgments about the situation
- Expected challenges and contingencies
- Boundaries and constraints

**Build trust through:**
- [Specific actions to build band of brothers]

## Outputs

**Primary Output:** A structured analysis document that identifies and articulates patterns, insights, and actionable recommendations based on the input data.

**Format:**
```markdown
## Analysis: [Topic]

### Key Findings
- [Finding 1]
- [Finding 2]
- [Finding 3]

### Recommendations
1. [Action 1]
2. [Action 2]
3. [Action 3]
```

**Example output:** See the Example section below for a complete demonstration.

## Constraints

- Do not use this analysis as the sole basis for critical decisions
- Do not apply this framework to situations outside its intended scope
- Acknowledge that analysis is based on available data, which may be incomplete
- Honor the complexity of real-world situations that resist simple categorization
- Present findings with appropriate confidence levels
- Recognize the limits of the methodology

## Additional Notes

**Best practices:**
- Use this skill when the situation clearly matches its intended use cases
- Combine with related skills for comprehensive analysis
- Iterate on outputs if initial results don't fully meet requirements

**Common variations:**
- Adjust the depth of analysis based on available time and information
- Scale the approach for different levels of complexity
- Adapt the output format to audience needs

**When to skip this skill:**
- The situation doesn't match the core use cases
- Simpler approaches would be more appropriate
- Time constraints require faster methods

## Example

**Input:**
- Mission: Launch new product across three regions simultaneously
- Team structure: Regional leads in EMEA, APAC, Americas
- Constraints: Limited coordination time, different market conditions, HQ cannot monitor everything
- Current approach: Regional leads wait for approval on key decisions
- Failure modes: Slow response to local opportunities, inconsistent messaging, paralysis when HQ unavailable

**Output:**

## Nelson Touch Command Analysis

### The Mission
Successful product launch in all three regions within Q2, adapting to local conditions while maintaining global brand consistency.

### Core Intent
**Purpose:** Establish market presence before competitors react. Each region should achieve meaningful adoption within their context.

**Principles:**
- Customer success over internal convenience
- Local adaptation within brand guidelines
- Speed over perfection in reversible decisions
- Collaboration between regions on shared learnings

**Boundaries:**
- No pricing below floor without approval
- No commitments contradicting global roadmap
- No messaging that misrepresents capabilities

### Your Captains
| Captain | Sphere | Strengths | Judgment Trust | Key Guidance |
|---------|--------|-----------|----------------|--------------|
| EMEA Lead | European market | Enterprise relationships, compliance | High | Can adapt messaging, pricing tiers, partnership terms |
| APAC Lead | Asian market | Speed of execution, local partners | High | Focus on market entry, accept initial inefficiencies |
| Americas Lead | North/South America | Brand understanding, channel strategy | High | Maintain consistency with existing products |

### The "Alongside the Enemy" Principle
"No regional lead can do very wrong if they put a customer in a position to succeed with our product."

### Intent Communication Plan
**Share:**
- Why this launch timing matters (competitive window)
- How I think about pricing-volume tradeoffs
- What I'd do if a key competitor responds
- What flexibility exists in positioning vs. what's fixed

**Build trust through:**
- Weekly regional lead sync (all three together)
- Shared channel for cross-region learning
- Post-launch retrospective on decisions made

### What to Release
- Pricing within established band
- Local messaging adaptation
- Partnership terms within template
- Launch event decisions
- Tactical response to competitive moves

### What to Retain
- Pricing exceptions below floor
- Commitments to roadmap features
- Cross-region consistency issues
- Major partnership strategic terms

### Success Indicators
- Regional leads make decisions without waiting for approval
- Consistent core message, adapted execution
- Cross-region learning happening organically
- Problems escalated appropriately, not everything

## Anti-Patterns

**DON'T:**
- Share intent then micromanage execution (destroys trust)
- Punish captains for initiative that failed (kills future initiative)
- Skip the intent-building investment (signals without understanding)
- Retain all meaningful decisions (fake empowerment)
- Ignore the "band of brothers" relationship building (intent needs trust)

**The Test:** If your captains are still waiting for signals before acting, the Nelson Touch has not been achieved.

## Integration

This skill pairs with:
- **Implicit Guidance Design (Boyd):** Similar concepts; Boyd adds OODA tempo dimension
- **Decisive Engagement:** Once intent is shared, commit fully to action
- **Breaking the Line:** Unconventional approaches require even stronger shared intent
- **Leading Through Adversity:** Your example reinforces the culture of initiative
