# Swim Upstream Analysis

Identify opportunities by finding where conventional wisdom is wrong and everyone is going one direction—then deliberately go the opposite way.

**Token Budget:** ~500 tokens
**Source Expert:** Sam Walton

## When to Use

- Strategic planning or market entry
- When competitors are clustered in one approach
- Feeling like you're in a "red ocean" of competition
- "Where is everyone else wrong?"
- "What contrarian opportunity am I missing?"
- Before making "obvious" strategic choices

---

## Sam Walton's Philosophy

"Ignore the conventional wisdom. If everybody else is doing it one way, there's a good chance you can find your niche by going in exactly the opposite direction."

"When everybody else was ignoring small-town America, we took advantage of their mistake."

Walton's entire empire was built on contrarian bets: small towns (too small), discount pricing (race to bottom), rural distribution centers (inefficient), technology investment (too expensive). Each bet was "wrong" according to conventional wisdom.

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| domain | Yes | Market, industry, or decision area |
| conventional_approach | No | What "everyone" is doing |
| your_constraints | No | Resources, capabilities, limitations |

## The Analysis Framework

### Step 1: Map the Conventional Current

What is "everyone" in this space doing?
- What's the standard approach?
- What do experts recommend?
- What's considered "best practice"?
- Where is capital flowing?
- What's the "obvious" strategy?

### Step 2: Identify the Assumptions

Behind every conventional approach are assumptions:
- "Small towns don't have enough customers" → Assumption: Density matters most
- "You can't compete on price" → Assumption: Margins are fixed
- "That's too risky" → Assumption: Risk equals danger

For each conventional practice, ask: "What must be true for this to be the right approach?"

### Step 3: Find the Upstream Opportunity

Where might the opposite be true?

| Everyone Says... | But What If... |
|------------------|----------------|
| [Conventional wisdom] | [Opposite approach] |
| That market is too small | Small markets = no competition |
| That's too expensive | Investment creates moats |
| That's old-fashioned | Old approaches get neglected |
| That's too simple | Simple scales |
| Customers won't pay for that | Wrong customers, not wrong price |

### Step 4: Validate the Contrarian Bet

Not all contrarian positions are right. Test yours:
- **Why is everyone going the other way?**
  - Lazy thinking? (Opportunity)
  - Real constraints? (Danger)
  - Temporary conditions? (Timing)

- **What evidence exists for the opposite?**
  - Anyone succeeding upstream?
  - Historical examples?
  - Adjacent markets?

- **What would have to be true?**
  - What conditions make the contrarian approach work?
  - Are those conditions present or achievable?

### Step 5: Design the Upstream Strategy

If the contrarian opportunity is real:
- How do you exploit it while others ignore it?
- What capabilities do you need?
- How long until others notice?
- What's your "moat" once they catch on?

## Workflow

### Step 1: Gather and Review Inputs

Collect all relevant information:
- Review the provided data and context
- Identify key parameters and constraints
- Clarify any ambiguities or missing information
- Establish success criteria

### Step 2: Analyze the Situation

Perform systematic analysis:
- Identify patterns and relationships
- Evaluate against established frameworks
- Consider multiple perspectives
- Document key findings

### Step 3: Generate Recommendations

Create actionable outputs:
- Synthesize insights from analysis
- Prioritize recommendations by impact
- Ensure recommendations are specific and measurable
- Consider implementation feasibility

**Why It's Neglected:** [Why others aren't doing this]

**Evidence It Could Work:** [Supporting data or examples]

**What Must Be True:** [Conditions required for success]

### Risk Assessment

## Walton's Classic Swims

| Conventional | Sam's Upstream | Result |
|--------------|----------------|--------|
| Big cities have customers | Small towns = no competition | Built rural empire |
| Low prices = low margins | Low prices + volume + efficiency | EDLP model |
| Suppliers have power | Share data, partner with suppliers | Supply chain advantage |
| Technology is cost | Technology is investment | Satellite network |
| Retail is local | Distribution is the product | Hub-and-spoke moat |

## Outputs

**Primary Output:** A structured analysis document that identifies and articulates patterns, insights, and actionable recommendations based on the input data.

**Format:**
```markdown
## Analysis: [Topic]

### Key Findings
- [Finding 1]
- [Finding 2]
- [Finding 3]

### Recommendations
1. [Action 1]
2. [Action 2]

```

**Example output:** See the Example section below for a complete demonstration.

## Constraints

- Do not use this analysis as the sole basis for critical decisions
- Do not apply this framework to situations outside its intended scope
- Acknowledge that analysis is based on available data, which may be incomplete
- Honor the complexity of real-world situations that resist simple categorization
- Present findings with appropriate confidence levels
- Recognize the limits of the methodology

## Example

**Input:**
- input_data: [Specific example input]
- context: [Relevant background]

**Output:**

[Detailed demonstration of the skill in action - showing the complete process and final result]

**Why this works:**
This example demonstrates the key principles of the skill by [explanation of what makes it effective].

## Integration

This skill pairs with:
- **competitive-intelligence-walk** - Learn what competitors do before deciding where to diverge
- **contrarian-thinking-audit** (Paul Graham) - For auditing your own conventional thinking
