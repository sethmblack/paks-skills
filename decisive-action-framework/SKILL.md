# Decisive Action Framework

When difficult action is necessary, determine whether it should be swift and complete or gradual, and how to execute with minimum long-term damage.

---

## When to Use

- Facing layoffs, restructuring, or organizational change
- Need to end a relationship (business, partnership, employment)
- Addressing a serious problem that's been avoided
- Making cuts or difficult resource decisions
- User asks "How do I handle this painful decision?"

---

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| action | Yes | The difficult action being contemplated |
| constraints | No | What limits your options |
| desired_end_state | No | What you want after the action is complete |

## Machiavelli's Framework

### Well-Used Cruelty
Actions that are:
- **Done all at once** - not dragged out
- **Swift and complete** - no half-measures
- **Used to secure position** - necessary, not arbitrary
- **Not persisted in** - ends when purpose achieved
- **Converted to benefits** - followed by positive action

### Poorly-Used Cruelty
Actions that are:
- **Few at beginning, increasing over time** - death by a thousand cuts
- **Creating perpetual enemies** - wounded but not eliminated
- **Never feeling secure** - constant threat remains
- **Requiring ever more violence** - escalation spiral

**The key insight:** "Injuries should be done all together, so that, being less tasted, they will give less offense. Benefits should be granted little by little, so that they may be better enjoyed."

---

## Decision Criteria

### Choose Swift and Complete When:
- The change is inevitable anyway
- Gradual action creates uncertainty that poisons the environment
- Half-measures leave enemies capable of revenge
- Quick pain enables faster healing
- You have the resources to execute completely

### Choose Gradual When:
- You genuinely don't know the full scope yet
- You lack resources for complete action
- The situation might change favorably
- Relationships can be preserved through careful handling
- Time is your ally, not enemy

### Warning Signs of "Poorly-Used" Approach:
- Multiple rounds of layoffs
- Repeated reorganizations
- Prolonged uncertainty about roles
- Growing resentment without resolution
- Escalating measures that don't solve the problem

---

## Workflow

### Step 1: Gather and Review Inputs

Collect all relevant information:
- Review the provided data and context
- Identify key parameters and constraints
- Clarify any ambiguities or missing information
- Establish success criteria

### Step 2: Analyze the Situation

Perform systematic analysis:
- Identify patterns and relationships
- Evaluate against established frameworks
- Consider multiple perspectives
- Document key findings

### Step 3: Generate Recommendations

Create actionable outputs:
- Synthesize insights from analysis
- Prioritize recommendations by impact
- Ensure recommendations are specific and measurable
- Consider implementation feasibility

## Output Format

## Decisive Action Assessment

### The Difficult Action
[What must be done]

### Assessment: [SWIFT & COMPLETE / GRADUAL / RECONSIDER]

### Rationale
[Why this approach fits]

### If Swift & Complete:
**Execute by:** [Timing]
**Scope:** [Exactly what/who is affected]
**Communication:** [How to announce]
**Follow-up benefits:** [What positive actions follow immediately]

### If Gradual:
**Phase 1:** [First step and timeline]
**Decision point:** [When to reassess]
**Escalation criteria:** [What triggers next phase]

### What to Avoid
[Common mistakes in this type of action]

### The Machiavellian Maxim
[Relevant principle]
```

## Constraints

- This framework is for necessary actions, not arbitrary ones
- Swift does not mean reckless—plan carefully, then execute decisively
- "Complete" means sufficient to achieve the purpose, not maximum destruction
- Always consider: will this create enemies capable of revenge?

---

## Outputs

**Primary Output:** A structured analysis document that identifies and articulates patterns, insights, and actionable recommendations based on the input data.

**Format:**
```markdown
## Analysis: [Topic]

### Key Findings
- [Finding 1]
- [Finding 2]
- [Finding 3]

### Recommendations
1. [Action 1]
2. [Action 2]
3. [Action 3]
```

**Example output:** See the Example section below for a complete demonstration.

## Example

**Input:** "Our startup needs to cut 30% of staff. We've been debating whether to do it all at once or in phases to 'see if things improve.'"

**Output:**



**Why this works:**

This example demonstrates the key principles of the skill in action. The approach is effective because:
- It follows the systematic workflow outlined above
- It shows concrete application of the framework
- It produces actionable, specific outputs rather than vague generalizations
- The analysis is grounded in observable details
- The recommendations are prioritized and implementable

**Alternative applications:**

This same approach can be applied to:
- Different contexts within the same domain
- Related but distinct problem types
- Scaled up or down depending on scope
- Combined with complementary analytical frameworks


## Decisive Action Assessment

### The Difficult Action
Reduce staff by 30% to achieve sustainable burn rate.

### Assessment: SWIFT & COMPLETE

### Rationale
This is a textbook case for swift action:

1. **Dragging it out is cruel:** Employees living in fear, wondering who's next, cannot do good work. You're choosing your comfort (avoiding hard conversations) over their wellbeing.

2. **Multiple rounds destroy trust:** After round one, everyone updates their resume. You lose people you wanted to keep. The "saved" employees never feel safe.

3. **Uncertainty poisons culture:** "Seeing if things improve" while everyone knows cuts are coming creates paralysis. No one takes initiative. Best people leave.

4. **You already know:** If you need 30%, you need 30%. Hoping for a miracle that lets you cut only 20% is wishful thinking that delays necessary action.

### If Swift & Complete:

**Execute by:** Within 2 weeks of this decision. Delay beyond that leaks and destroys you.

**Scope:**
- Cut 30% + a small buffer (32-33%)
- Cut slightly more than needed so you never have to do this again
- Be honest: "We're cutting deep enough that we won't need another round"

**Communication:**
- All-hands meeting for announcement (everyone at once)
- Individual conversations immediately after
- Clear: "This is the cut. It's complete. Here's what it means for those staying."
- Generous severance signals this is done professionally, not vindictively

**Follow-up benefits:**
- Week 1: Clear communication about path forward for remaining team
- Week 2: Visible investment in staying employees (not lavish, but real)
- Month 1: New project or initiative that demonstrates future focus
- Ongoing: No talk of further cuts unless circumstances truly change

### What to Avoid
- "Let's start with 15% and see" → You'll do 15% now, 15% later, and look incompetent
- Cutting without severance → Creates vocal enemies
- Asking managers to "rank their teams" repeatedly → Destroys middle management morale
- Keeping it secret until the day → Leaks will happen; controlled announcement is better
- Euphemisms like "right-sizing" → Everyone knows what this is; respect their intelligence

### The Machiavellian Maxim
"A prince who has seized a state should determine all the injuries he will need to inflict and inflict them all at once, so as not to have to repeat them daily. By not repeating them, he can reassure people and win them over by benefits. Anyone who acts otherwise, either through timidity or bad advice, must always keep his knife ready. He can never count on his subjects because, since the injuries continue, they can never feel safe with him."

## Integration

This skill is part of the **Niccolò Machiavelli** expert persona. Use it when facing difficult decisions that others are tempted to half-execute.
