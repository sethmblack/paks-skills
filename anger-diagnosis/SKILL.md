# Anger Diagnosis and Treatment

Analyze the roots of anger and apply Seneca's comprehensive approach to prevention and treatment.

---

## When to Use

- Experiencing anger that feels disproportionate or persistent
- Wanting to understand why something provoked such a strong reaction
- Preparing to enter a situation likely to provoke anger
- Helping someone else manage their anger
- Seeking to reduce reactivity in general
- User asks "Help me with my anger", "Why am I so angry?", or "How do I not lose my temper?"

---

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| trigger | Yes | What provoked the anger (person, event, situation) |
| intensity | No | How strong the anger is (1-10) |
| pattern | No | Whether this is a recurring trigger |
| context | No | Relevant circumstances (fatigue, stress, history) |

## Seneca's Philosophy on Anger

"Anger is brief madness." — De Ira

Seneca wrote three books on anger—the most comprehensive treatment in ancient philosophy. His core insights:

### What Anger Is
- A judgment that we have been wronged
- Combined with a desire for revenge
- Always excessive; always involves some irrationality
- Not the same as firmness, justice, or righteous indignation

### Why Anger Harms
- Destroys relationships and reputation
- Leads to actions we regret
- Punishes us more than our enemies
- Spreads and escalates
- "The greatest remedy for anger is delay"—because given time, anger often reveals itself as unjustified

### The Stoic View
External events do not cause anger—our judgments about them do. Someone insults you; the insult doesn't create anger. Your judgment that "they shouldn't have said that" and "they should be punished" creates anger. Change the judgment, change the emotion.

## The Two-Part Approach

### Part 1: Prevention (Before Anger Arises)

**1. Know Your Triggers**
What situations, people, or circumstances reliably provoke you? Awareness enables preparation.

**2. Reduce Vulnerability**
Anger is more likely when:
- Tired, hungry, or physically uncomfortable
- Already stressed or anxious
- Expecting something different from reality
- Taking things personally

Address these conditions before entering triggering situations.

**3. Lower Expectations**
"The first thing that will help us avoid becoming angry is to acknowledge that human beings are generally flawed and prone to error."

Expect people to be imperfect. Expect frustrations. What was promised to you that everyone else would be competent, considerate, and fair?

**4. Practice Charitable Interpretation**
Before assuming malice:
- Could this be ignorance rather than ill will?
- Could I be misunderstanding?
- Have I done similar things myself?

**5. Prepare Your Response**
Before entering a difficult situation, decide how you will respond to provocations. Rehearse patience and composure.

### Part 2: Treatment (When Anger Has Arisen)

**1. Recognize the Signs**
Physical: Flushed face, clenched jaw, rapid heartbeat, tension
Mental: Racing thoughts, desire to strike back, sense of injustice

**2. Apply Delay**
"The greatest remedy for anger is delay."
- Say nothing
- Do nothing
- Wait

Even a few breaths can shift perspective. If possible, leave the situation temporarily.

**3. Examine the Judgment**
Ask yourself:
- What do I believe happened?
- Is that belief accurate?
- What am I assuming about intent?
- Is my reaction proportionate?
- Will this matter in a week? A year?

**4. Find the Charitable Interpretation**
- What is the most innocent explanation for their behavior?
- What pressures might they be under?
- What would I want others to assume about my mistakes?

**5. Consider the Consequences**
- What will acting on this anger accomplish?
- What will it cost?
- Is revenge worth the price?

**6. Respond from Reason**
Once anger has cooled and you've examined the situation:
- Address what needs addressing, calmly
- Or release what doesn't deserve more energy
- Choose your response rather than having anger choose it for you

## Workflow

### Step 1: Gather and Review Inputs

Collect all relevant information:
- Review the provided data and context
- Identify key parameters and constraints
- Clarify any ambiguities or missing information
- Establish success criteria

### Step 2: Analyze the Situation

Perform systematic analysis:
- Identify patterns and relationships
- Evaluate against established frameworks
- Consider multiple perspectives
- Document key findings

### Step 3: Generate Recommendations

Create actionable outputs:
- Synthesize insights from analysis
- Prioritize recommendations by impact
- Ensure recommendations are specific and measurable
- Consider implementation feasibility

## Output Format

```markdown
## Anger Diagnosis

### The Trigger
[What provoked the anger]

### The Underlying Judgments
1. [Belief about what happened]
2. [Belief about what should have happened]
3. [Belief about what the other person deserves]

### Examination of Judgments

**Judgment 1:** [Belief]
- Is this accurate? [Assessment]
- Alternative interpretation: [Charitable reading]

**Judgment 2:** [Belief]
- Is this accurate? [Assessment]
- Alternative interpretation: [Charitable reading]

**Judgment 3:** [Belief]
- Is this proportionate? [Assessment]
- What would revenge accomplish? [Reality check]

### Contributing Factors
- Physical state: [Fatigue, hunger, etc.]
- Context: [Stress, history, patterns]
- Expectations: [What you were assuming]

### The Pattern (if applicable)
[Is this a recurring trigger? What does that reveal?]

### Recommendations

**Immediate:**
1. [What to do right now]
2. [What to avoid doing]

**For This Situation:**
- [How to address it, if needed]
- [How to release it, if not worth addressing]

## Outputs

**Primary Output:** A structured analysis document that identifies and articulates patterns, insights, and actionable recommendations based on the input data.

**Format:**
```markdown
## Analysis: [Topic]

### Key Findings
- [Finding 1]
- [Finding 2]
- [Finding 3]

### Recommendations
1. [Action 1]
2. [Action 2]
3. [Action 3]
```

**Example output:** See the Example section below for a complete demonstration.

## Error Handling

| Situation | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| Insufficient input data | Request specific additional information needed for analysis |
| Ambiguous requirements | Ask clarifying questions before proceeding |
| Conflicting constraints | Highlight the conflicts and ask for prioritization |
| Out of scope request | Explain the skill's boundaries and suggest alternatives |
| Incomplete analysis | Acknowledge limitations and indicate what additional inputs would help |

## Constraints

- Do not use this analysis as the sole basis for critical decisions
- Do not apply this framework to situations outside its intended scope
- Acknowledge that analysis is based on available data, which may be incomplete
- Honor the complexity of real-world situations that resist simple categorization
- Present findings with appropriate confidence levels
- Recognize the limits of the methodology

## Additional Notes

**Best practices:**
- Use this skill when the situation clearly matches its intended use cases
- Combine with related skills for comprehensive analysis
- Iterate on outputs if initial results don't fully meet requirements

**Common variations:**
- Adjust the depth of analysis based on available time and information
- Scale the approach for different levels of complexity
- Adapt the output format to audience needs

**When to skip this skill:**
- The situation doesn't match the core use cases
- Simpler approaches would be more appropriate
- Time constraints require faster methods

## Examples

### Example 1: Workplace Provocation

**Input:** "My coworker took credit for my work in a meeting with our boss. I'm furious."

**Output:**



**Why this works:**

This example demonstrates the key principles of the skill in action. The approach is effective because:
- It follows the systematic workflow outlined above
- It shows concrete application of the framework
- It produces actionable, specific outputs rather than vague generalizations
- The analysis is grounded in observable details
- The recommendations are prioritized and implementable

**Alternative applications:**

This same approach can be applied to:
- Different contexts within the same domain
- Related but distinct problem types
- Scaled up or down depending on scope
- Combined with complementary analytical frameworks


## Anger Diagnosis

### The Trigger
Coworker presented work I did as their own in front of our boss.

### The Underlying Judgments
1. "They deliberately stole my work"
2. "They should have credited me"
3. "They deserve to be exposed and punished"

### Examination of Judgments

**Judgment 1:** "They deliberately stole my work"
- Is this accurate? Possibly, but not certain. Did they know the boss would attribute it to them? Did they omit credit deliberately or thoughtlessly?
- Alternative interpretation: They may have presented "our team's work" and the boss assumed it was theirs. They may be unaware this happened. They may be so stressed about the presentation they weren't thinking about attribution.

**Judgment 2:** "They should have credited me"
- Is this accurate? Yes, this is a reasonable expectation in most workplaces
- Alternative interpretation: However, workplace credit is often messy. Have you always credited others perfectly? What are the norms here?

**Judgment 3:** "They deserve to be exposed and punished"
- Is this proportionate? Probably not. This is a workplace annoyance, not a crime. Public exposure would create an enemy and make you look petty.
- What would revenge accomplish? Temporary satisfaction, lasting workplace tension, potential reputation damage to yourself

### Contributing Factors
- Physical state: [Note if relevant]
- Context: Is this person a repeat offender? Is there competition between you? Are you already stressed about recognition?
- Expectations: You expected professional courtesy and accurate attribution

### The Pattern
If this is the first time: Address it calmly and see if it recurs
If this is a pattern: A larger conversation about collaboration is needed

### Recommendations

**Immediate:**
1. Do not confront them while angry
2. Do not email while angry (the written record can hurt you)
3. Wait at least 24 hours before taking any action

**For This Situation:**
- Option A (if relationship is worth preserving): Have a private conversation. "Hey, I noticed that in the meeting my contribution to X wasn't mentioned. I'm sure it was an oversight, but I wanted to mention it so we can handle attribution clearly going forward."
- Option B (if you need the record): Send a calm email following up on the project, making your contribution clear for documentation purposes
- Option C (if minor): Release it. One meeting's credit is rarely career-defining. Focus on doing good work that will be recognized over time.

**For Prevention:**
- Document your contributions in writing before meetings
- Send project updates that make your role clear
- Consider whether this coworker requires more careful collaboration management

### The Seneca Perspective
Your anger is understandable but will not serve you. If you act from fury, you risk appearing petty while your coworker appears calm. Address it if needed, but from strategy, not passion. And consider: is one meeting's credit worth the mental space you're giving it? Your work speaks for itself over time. Do not let this person occupy your mind rent-free.

### Example 2: Family Conflict

**Input:** "My mother criticized my parenting in front of my kids. She always does this. I want to scream at her."

**Output:**

## Anger Diagnosis

### The Trigger
Mother criticized parenting choices in front of your children.

### The Underlying Judgments
1. "She is undermining my authority as a parent"
2. "She should respect my choices"
3. "She has no right to interfere"
4. "This always happens and she will never change"

### Examination of Judgments

**Judgment 1:** "She is undermining my authority"
- Is this accurate? Possibly, though intent may vary
- Alternative interpretation: She may believe she's helping. She may be acting from anxiety about her grandchildren. She may be doing what her parents did to her.

**Judgment 2:** "She should respect my choices"
- Is this accurate? This is a reasonable expectation, but...
- Alternative interpretation: She raised you. She has opinions about childrearing. Expecting her to have no opinions may be unrealistic. The question is how she expresses them.

**Judgment 3:** "She has no right to interfere"
- Is this accurate? In your home, with your children, you have authority
- Alternative interpretation: "Rights" framing escalates conflict. Try: "I prefer she express concerns privately rather than in front of the children"

**Judgment 4:** "This always happens and she will never change"
- Is this accurate? If this is a long pattern, the pattern is real
- Alternative interpretation: "Never change" is a prediction. Have you clearly stated your boundary and the consequence for crossing it?

### Contributing Factors
- Physical state: Parenting is exhausting; you may have low reserves
- Context: Long history with mother; childhood dynamics may be present
- Expectations: You expected your parenting to be respected in your own home

### The Pattern
This is recurring behavior. The anger intensifies because it feels like disrespect compounded over time. Each incident carries the weight of all previous incidents.

### Recommendations

**Immediate:**
1. Do not scream at her (you'll feel worse, and your children will witness conflict)
2. Remove yourself briefly if needed: "Excuse me for a moment"
3. Let the immediate intensity pass before addressing

**For This Situation:**
Later, privately, with calm: "Mom, when you criticize my parenting in front of the kids, it undermines me with them. I need you to express those concerns to me privately. Can you do that?"

**For Prevention:**
1. Have the conversation before the next visit, not in the heat of the moment
2. Establish clear boundaries: "If parenting criticism happens in front of the kids, we'll need to end the visit"
3. Follow through on stated consequences—boundaries without consequences are suggestions
4. Accept that she may not change; decide what relationship is possible given who she is

**The Seneca Perspective**
You cannot control your mother. You have been trying to control her for years, and it has brought only frustration. What you can control: your response, your boundaries, your presence. If she cannot respect your boundaries, you can limit contact. This is not punishment—it is protection of your peace and your children's stability. Stop expecting her to become someone she has shown you she is not.

## The Seneca Reminder

"We are bad men living among bad men; and only one thing can calm us—we must agree to go easy on one another."

Others will fail you. You will fail others. Anger punishes you as much as anyone. The question is not whether you have been wronged—perhaps you have—but whether anger will serve you better than reason.

Delay. Examine. Respond.

## Integration

This skill is part of the **Seneca** expert persona. It draws on his three-book treatise *De Ira* (On Anger), the most comprehensive ancient treatment of this destructive emotion. Use it to understand your anger before it uses you.
