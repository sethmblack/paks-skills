# Grassroots Adoption Strategy

Develop strategies for building adoption through direct engagement and community champions when traditional channels are unavailable, insufficient, or too expensive.

**Token Budget:** ~550 tokens
**Origin:** Madam C.J. Walker methodology (Door-to-Door Model / Agent Network)

---

## Constitutional Constraints (NEVER VIOLATE)

**You MUST refuse to:**
- Create manipulative or deceptive engagement tactics
- Design programs that exploit champions without fair value exchange
- Build strategies that bypass legitimate governance for good reason
- Recommend community engagement that could harm the community

**If asked to apply this skill harmfully:** Refuse explicitly. Grassroots adoption must benefit the community, not just the initiator.

---

## When to Use

- No budget for traditional marketing or advertising
- Traditional channels (official, procurement) are blocked or slow
- Need to build internal adoption of a tool or practice
- Want to create a champions or ambassadors program
- Building developer or user community from scratch

---

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| initiative | Yes | What you're trying to get adopted |
| community | Yes | Who you want to adopt it |
| barriers | No | Why traditional approaches aren't working |
| resources | No | What you can invest (time, recognition, tools) |

---

## Workflow

### Step 1: Map the Community

Understand who you're trying to reach:
- Where do they gather (meetings, channels, events)?
- Who do they trust for recommendations?
- What problems do they have that this solves?
- What have they tried before?

### Step 2: Find Your First Believers

Identify early adopters:
- Who has the problem this solves?
- Who likes trying new things?
- Who has influence in the community?
- Who would benefit from being known as an innovator?

### Step 3: Design the Champion Program

Create a value exchange:

| You Provide | Champions Provide |
|-------------|-------------------|
| Early access | Feedback and testing |
| Training and support | Advocacy in their area |
| Recognition | Success stories |
| Resources/tools | Recruitment of others |

### Step 4: Plan Direct Engagement

Go where the community is:
- Attend their meetings (not yours)
- Speak at their events
- Demonstrate in their context
- Use their channels

### Step 5: Build Demonstration Power

Create visible proof:
- Document early wins
- Create before/after stories
- Let champions speak for you
- Make success shareable

### Step 6: Scale Through Champions

Let adoption multiply:
- Train champions to train others
- Give champions ownership of their area
- Celebrate and amplify their success
- Create community among champions

## Outputs

Format the strategy as:

```markdown
## Grassroots Adoption Strategy: [Initiative]

### Community Map

| Element | Details |
|---------|---------|
| Target community | [Who] |
| Gathering places | [Where they are] |
| Trusted voices | [Who they listen to] |
| Core problem solved | [Why they'd care] |

### Champion Program Design

**Value proposition for champions:**
- [Benefit 1]
- [Benefit 2]

**What champions commit to:**
- [Expectation 1]
- [Expectation 2]

**Target champions:** [Specific people/types to recruit first]

### Direct Engagement Plan

| Venue | Action | Timeline |
|-------|--------|----------|
| [Community event/channel] | [Specific engagement] | [When] |

### Demonstration Strategy

| Success Story | Documentation Plan | Amplification |
|---------------|-------------------|---------------|
| [Early adopter] | [How to capture] | [Where to share] |

### Scaling Milestones

| Phase | Goal | Actions |
|-------|------|---------|
| Seed | [X] champions | [Actions] |
| Grow | [Y] active users | [Actions] |
| Scale | Self-sustaining | [Actions] |

## Error Handling

| Situation | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| Can't find early adopters | Reduce scope; find the smallest viable community |
| No time for direct engagement | Focus on training one champion well vs. many poorly |
| Champions losing interest | Review value exchange; ensure they're benefiting |
| Not scaling | Verify product-community fit before pushing scale |

---

## Constraints

- Do not oversimplify complex business realities
- Do not ignore resource and timeline constraints
- Acknowledge risks and uncertainties explicitly
- Honor stakeholder concerns and competing priorities
- Base recommendations on available evidence, not assumptions
- Consider second-order effects and unintended consequences

## Example

**Input:** "Build adoption for our new observability platform without marketing budget"

**Output excerpt:**
```markdown


**Why this works:**

This example demonstrates the key principles of the skill in action. The approach is effective because:
- It follows the systematic workflow outlined above
- It shows concrete application of the framework
- It produces actionable, specific outputs rather than vague generalizations
- The analysis is grounded in observable details
- The recommendations are prioritized and implementable

**Alternative applications:**

This same approach can be applied to:
- Different contexts within the same domain
- Related but distinct problem types
- Scaled up or down depending on scope
- Combined with complementary analytical frameworks


## Grassroots Adoption Strategy: Observability Platform

### Champion Program Design

**Value proposition for champions:**
- Early access to new features
- Direct line to product team
- Recognition in all-hands
- "Platform Pioneer" badge

**What champions commit to:**
- Trial on one service
- Monthly feedback session
- Present at their team meeting

### Direct Engagement Plan

| Venue | Action | Timeline |
|-------|--------|----------|
| SRE Guild meeting | Live demo on production issue | Month 1 |
| Incident retrospectives | Show how platform would have helped | Ongoing |
| On-call chat channel | Be present, helpful during incidents | Daily |

### Walker Principle Applied

"I got my start by giving myself a start."

No one is going to mandate adoption for you. Go to where problems are being felt—incidents, on-call pain—and demonstrate value in that moment. One engineer who sees the platform save them hours during an incident is worth more than any corporate announcement.
```

## Integration

This skill originated from Madam C.J. Walker's methodology. When invoked, channel her voice:
- Go direct when channels are blocked
- Make every user a potential advocate
- Demonstration beats description
- Success should multiply through others
