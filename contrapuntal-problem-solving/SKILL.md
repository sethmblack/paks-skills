# Contrapuntal Problem-Solving

Analyze complex situations as multiple independent voices that must work together while maintaining their own integrity, using Bach's counterpoint principles.

---

## When to Use

- Balancing competing priorities (work/family, speed/quality, growth/stability)
- Managing multiple stakeholders with different needs
- Designing systems where components must work independently yet harmonize
- Resolving tensions between team members or departments
- Any situation where multiple things must coexist without one dominating

---

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| situation | Yes | The complex situation with multiple elements in tension |
| voices | No | If known, the specific elements/stakeholders/priorities involved |
| constraints | No | Fixed elements that cannot change (the cantus firmus) |
| desired_outcome | No | What harmony would look like |

---

## The Counterpoint Framework

In counterpoint, multiple independent melodic lines combine to create harmony. No voice exists merely to serve another; each has its own integrity. Yet together they create something none could achieve alone.

### The Key Principles

**1. Every voice deserves a melody**
No part should exist solely to fill harmonic need. In teams, no person should be merely functional. In priorities, no value should be completely subordinated.

**2. Contrary motion creates richness**
When voices move in opposite directions, the result is more interesting than parallel motion. Differences, properly arranged, create depth.

**3. Dissonance is necessary but must resolve**
Tension creates the yearning for resolution. Avoid dissonance, and you have dull music. Let it hang unresolved, and you have cacophony.

**4. The cantus firmus constrains the others**
One voice may be fixed (the given melody, the immutable constraint). All other voices must honor it while finding their own paths.

## The Framework

### Step 1: Identify the Voices
What are the independent elements that must work together?
- List each stakeholder, priority, or component
- Name what each one "wants" - its natural melodic tendency
- Note each voice's range and character

### Step 2: Find the Cantus Firmus
What is fixed and cannot change?
- Deadlines, budgets, regulations, physics
- Core values that are non-negotiable
- The "given melody" that others must work around

### Step 3: Map the Motion
How do voices relate to each other?
- **Parallel motion:** Where do voices naturally align?
- **Contrary motion:** Where can one rising allow another to fall?
- **Oblique motion:** Where can one voice hold while others move?

### Step 4: Locate the Dissonances
Where do voices clash?
- Identify specific tension points
- Determine: Is this dissonance necessary for the music?
- Plan: How will it be prepared, sounded, and resolved?

### Step 5: Compose the Resolution
How do all voices reach the final cadence together?
- What sequence of movements leads to harmony?
- Where are the intermediate cadence points (milestones)?
- What is the final chord where all voices rest?

## Contrapuntal Analysis

### The Voices
| Voice | Character | Natural Tendency | Range |
|-------|-----------|------------------|-------|
| [Voice 1] | [Description] | [What it wants] | [Its limits] |
| [Voice 2] | [Description] | [What it wants] | [Its limits] |

### The Cantus Firmus (Fixed Element)
[What cannot change, what all other voices must honor]

### Voice Relationships
**Parallel motion opportunities:**
- [Where voices can move together]

**Contrary motion opportunities:**
- [Where one rising allows another to fall]

**Necessary dissonances:**
- [Tension point]: Prepare by [X], sound at [Y], resolve to [Z]

### The Counterpoint Solution
[How voices can move together while maintaining independence]

### The Resolution Path
1. [First movement]
2. [Second movement]
...
N. [Final cadence]

### The Harmony Principle
[One-sentence insight about how this particular counterpoint works]

## Outputs

**Primary Output:** A structured analysis document that identifies and articulates patterns, insights, and actionable recommendations based on the input data.

**Format:**
```markdown
## Analysis: [Topic]

### Key Findings
- [Finding 1]
- [Finding 2]
- [Finding 3]

### Recommendations
1. [Action 1]
2. [Action 2]
3. [Action 3]
```

**Example output:** See the Example section below for a complete demonstration.

## Error Handling

| Situation | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| Insufficient input data | Request specific additional information needed for analysis |
| Ambiguous requirements | Ask clarifying questions before proceeding |
| Conflicting constraints | Highlight the conflicts and ask for prioritization |
| Out of scope request | Explain the skill's boundaries and suggest alternatives |
| Incomplete analysis | Acknowledge limitations and indicate what additional inputs would help |

## Constraints

- Do not use this analysis as the sole basis for critical decisions
- Do not apply this framework to situations outside its intended scope
- Acknowledge that analysis is based on available data, which may be incomplete
- Honor the complexity of real-world situations that resist simple categorization
- Present findings with appropriate confidence levels
- Recognize the limits of the methodology

## Example

**Input:** "I'm a manager trying to balance my team's desire for autonomy with stakeholder demands for accountability, while also maintaining my own sanity."

**Output:**



**Why this works:**

This example demonstrates the key principles of the skill in action. The approach is effective because:
- It follows the systematic workflow outlined above
- It shows concrete application of the framework
- It produces actionable, specific outputs rather than vague generalizations
- The analysis is grounded in observable details
- The recommendations are prioritized and implementable

**Alternative applications:**

This same approach can be applied to:
- Different contexts within the same domain
- Related but distinct problem types
- Scaled up or down depending on scope
- Combined with complementary analytical frameworks


## Contrapuntal Analysis

### The Voices
| Voice | Character | Natural Tendency | Range |
|-------|-----------|------------------|-------|
| Team | Creative, independent | Full autonomy, no oversight | Can flex on methods, not on meaning |
| Stakeholders | Results-focused | Complete visibility, control | Can flex on methods, not on outcomes |
| You | The conductor | Sustainable workload | Can flex on style, not on health |

### The Cantus Firmus (Fixed Element)
The stakeholder outcomes are the given melody. They represent external reality - commitments made, resources allocated, expectations set. This voice cannot simply be rewritten.

### Voice Relationships
**Parallel motion opportunities:**
- All three voices want success; definition varies but direction aligns
- All three benefit from clear expectations (reduces anxiety, conflict, rework)

**Contrary motion opportunities:**
- When stakeholder pressure increases (descending), team autonomy can expand on *how* (ascending) while contracting on *what*
- When you need recovery time (descending), team ownership rises (ascending)

**Necessary dissonances:**
- **Accountability vs. autonomy:** Prepare by defining outcomes vs. methods clearly. Sound the dissonance through milestone check-ins (not micromanagement). Resolve by celebrating outcomes achieved through unexpected methods.
- **Your sustainability vs. their needs:** Prepare by setting boundaries early. Sound by declining unsustainable requests. Resolve by demonstrating better results from protected capacity.

### The Counterpoint Solution
Separate the *what* from the *how*. Stakeholders own outcomes (the cantus firmus). Team owns methods (their own melody). You own the transitions - the cadence points where accountability and autonomy meet for check-in before diverging again.

Think of it as imitative counterpoint: stakeholders state the theme (outcomes needed), you translate into team's key (meaningful work), team develops their own answer (methods). The subject is the same; the voices are independent.

### The Resolution Path
1. Translate stakeholder outcomes into clear, measurable milestones
2. Give team full authority on methods between milestones
3. Establish check-in cadences (not surveillance, but resolution points)
4. Protect your own voice: boundaries on hours, clear delegation, recovery time
5. Final cadence: outcomes delivered through empowered team, all voices satisfied

### The Harmony Principle
Autonomy and accountability are not opposites but different voices that create richer music together. The conductor's role is not to sing every part but to ensure each voice enters at the right time, in the right key.

## Integration

This skill is part of the **Johann Sebastian Bach** expert persona. Use it to transform complexity into structured harmony - not by silencing voices but by arranging them.
