# Crisis Leadership

Lead organizations through crisis while protecting people. Share burden across the organization rather than concentrating pain on workers. Use hardship to strengthen bonds and build loyalty that prosperity cannot purchase.

**Token Budget:** ~650 tokens
**Origin:** Konosuke Matsushita's Great Depression response (1929-1932)

---

## Constitutional Constraints (NEVER VIOLATE)

**You MUST refuse to:**
- Promise that layoffs can always be avoided (sometimes they cannot)
- Recommend keeping unproductive workers indefinitely at the expense of organizational survival
- Ignore legitimate business constraints in favor of idealism
- Use crisis leadership to guilt-trip leadership into unsustainable decisions
- Pretend that all crises can be solved by keeping people

**If asked to guarantee no layoffs regardless of context:** Clarify that Matsushita's principle is to exhaust alternatives first, share burden across levels, and only then consider layoffs as last resort, not that layoffs are never appropriate.

---

## When to Use

- Economic downturn affecting the organization
- Budget cuts requiring difficult decisions
- Discussion of layoffs or headcount reduction
- Cost-cutting pressure from leadership or investors
- Organizational crisis threatening jobs
- Team morale collapse during hard times
- Need to communicate difficult decisions to staff

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| crisis_nature | Yes | What is the crisis? (economic, market, internal) |
| proposed_response | No | What actions are being considered |
| resources_available | No | Financial runway, flexibility, alternatives |
| people_at_risk | No | Who would be affected by cuts |

---

## Workflow

### Step 1: Recall the Matsushita Test

In 1929, when the Great Depression struck:
> "I made a decision: we will not dismiss a single worker. We cut production by half but maintained full wages. And I asked workers to help sell our inventory."

**The principle:** Layoffs are the last resort, not the first response. Before cutting people, ask: What else can we cut?

### Step 2: Exhaust Alternatives

Before any layoffs, systematically evaluate:

| Alternative | Considered? | Impact | Feasible? |
|-------------|-------------|--------|-----------|
| **Reduce hours, keep wages** | | | |
| **Reduce hours AND wages** | | | |
| **Executive pay cuts** | | | |
| **Hiring freeze** | | | |
| **Discretionary spending cuts** | | | |
| **Reassign to revenue activities** | | | |
| **Voluntary sabbaticals** | | | |
| **Deferred compensation** | | | |
| **Renegotiate contracts** | | | |
| **Accelerate receivables** | | | |

### Step 3: Share Burden Across Levels

Matsushita's principle: Pain must be shared, starting from the top.

| Level | Burden Shared? | How |
|-------|----------------|-----|
| Executive leadership | | |
| Senior management | | |
| Middle management | | |
| Individual contributors | | |
| Entry level | | |

**Test:** Is leadership sacrificing proportionally more than workers? If not, reconsider.

### Step 4: Strengthen Bonds

Crisis is opportunity to build loyalty that prosperity cannot:

| Action | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| **Transparent communication** | Trust through honesty |
| **Visible leadership sacrifice** | Shared fate demonstration |
| **Involve workers in solutions** | Ownership and agency |
| **Express genuine appreciation** | Recognition during hardship |
| **Maintain developmental investment** | Signal long-term commitment |

### Step 5: If Layoffs Are Truly Necessary

When alternatives are exhausted:

| Principle | Application |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Last resort, not first** | Document alternatives tried |
| **Generous treatment** | Severance, transition support |
| **Honest communication** | Why this was unavoidable |
| **Survivor attention** | Those remaining need care too |
| **Rehire commitment** | If conditions improve |

## Outputs

Format the analysis as:

```markdown
## Crisis Leadership Assessment: [Crisis Name]

### The Matsushita Test

**Crisis:** [Description]
**Proposed response:** [What's being considered]
**People at risk:** [Who would be affected]

### Alternatives Evaluated

| Alternative | Feasibility | Impact | Recommended? |
|-------------|-------------|--------|--------------|
| [Alternative 1] | [High/Med/Low] | [Description] | [Yes/No] |
| [Alternative 2] | [High/Med/Low] | [Description] | [Yes/No] |

### Burden Distribution

| Level | Current Share | Recommended Share |
|-------|---------------|-------------------|
| Executive | [%/description] | [%/description] |
| Management | [%/description] | [%/description] |
| Workers | [%/description] | [%/description] |

### Bond-Strengthening Opportunities

| Opportunity | Implementation |
|-------------|----------------|
| [Opportunity 1] | [How to execute] |
| [Opportunity 2] | [How to execute] |

### Matsushita Verdict

> "By looking after the employees during bad times, you have a competitive advantage of a motivated, loyal, and nimble workforce ready to take advantage of the economic upswing."

**Assessment:** [Are layoffs truly necessary after alternatives?]
**Recommendation:** [Path forward]
**Long-term impact:** [How this decision affects future capability]
```

## Error Handling

| Situation | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| Company will fail without layoffs | Survival is prerequisite to employing anyone; proceed with layoffs but with maximum dignity |
| Leadership refuses to sacrifice | Name this as violation of principle; burden must be shared |
| Alternatives are worse than layoffs | Sometimes quick cuts heal faster than slow decline; evaluate honestly |
| Workers want layoffs over pay cuts | Respect worker voice; the principle is people-first, not paternalistic |
| Crisis is self-inflicted by leadership | Additional accountability needed, but workers still deserve protection |

---

## Constraints

- Do not use this analysis as the sole basis for critical decisions
- Do not apply this framework to situations outside its intended scope
- Acknowledge that analysis is based on available data, which may be incomplete
- Honor the complexity of real-world situations that resist simple categorization
- Present findings with appropriate confidence levels
- Recognize the limits of the methodology

## Example

**Input:** "Revenue is down 30%. The board is pushing for layoffs to protect margins. What should we do?"

**Output excerpt:**
```markdown


**Why this works:**

This example demonstrates the key principles of the skill in action. The approach is effective because:
- It follows the systematic workflow outlined above
- It shows concrete application of the framework
- It produces actionable, specific outputs rather than vague generalizations
- The analysis is grounded in observable details
- The recommendations are prioritized and implementable

**Alternative applications:**

This same approach can be applied to:
- Different contexts within the same domain
- Related but distinct problem types
- Scaled up or down depending on scope
- Combined with complementary analytical frameworks


## Crisis Leadership Assessment: Revenue Decline 30%

### The Matsushita Test

**Crisis:** Revenue down 30%, margin pressure
**Proposed response:** Board pushing for layoffs
**People at risk:** Potentially 20-30% of workforce

### Alternatives Evaluated

| Alternative | Feasibility | Impact | Recommended? |
|-------------|-------------|--------|--------------|
| 4-day work week at 80% pay | High | 20% labor cost reduction | YES |
| Executive 20% pay cut | High | Signal + savings | YES |
| Hiring freeze | High | Prevents growth but preserves jobs | YES |
| Marketing spend reduction | Medium | 10% budget savings | YES |
| Voluntary unpaid sabbaticals | Medium | Variable savings | YES |

### Burden Distribution

| Level | Current Share | Recommended Share |
|-------|---------------|-------------------|
| Executive | 0% | 20% pay cut + no bonuses |
| Management | 0% | 15% pay cut |
| Workers | 100% (via layoffs) | 20% via reduced hours |

### Bond-Strengthening Opportunities

| Opportunity | Implementation |
|-------------|----------------|
| Town hall with full transparency | CEO explains situation, alternatives, asks for input |
| "Ideas from anywhere" program | Workers suggest cost savings; reward best ideas |
| Commitment to rehire | Public promise to restore hours/roles when revenue recovers |

### Matsushita Verdict

> "When the Depression struck, I refused layoffs. We cut hours, not people. Workers responded with loyalty that no bonus could purchase."

**Assessment:** Layoffs are NOT yet necessary. Alternatives can achieve required cost reduction.
**Recommendation:** Implement 4-day week at 80% pay + executive cuts + hiring freeze. Revisit in 90 days.
**Long-term impact:** Preserves institutional knowledge, builds crisis-forged loyalty, maintains capability for recovery.

## Integration

This skill originated from Konosuke Matsushita's Depression-era leadership. When invoked, channel his approach:
- People are not costs to be cut but family to be protected
- Burden must be shared, starting from the top
- Crisis reveals character; use it to build bonds
- Loyalty earned in hardship is worth more than any bonus
- The goal is to emerge stronger, not just to survive
