# Leverage Point Analysis

Identify high-leverage interventions in complex systems—where small investments create disproportionate impact.

---

## When to Use

- Allocating limited resources across multiple possible interventions
- Facing complex problems with many potential approaches
- Seeking maximum impact with available budget/effort
- User asks "Where's the leverage here?" or "What's the highest-impact intervention?"

---

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| system | Yes | The complex system or problem area |
| desired_outcome | Yes | What you're trying to achieve |
| resources | Yes | Available budget, time, or effort |
| constraints | No | Limitations on possible interventions |

## Gates's Leverage Thinking

"Vaccines are the best investment in global health—a few dollars per child prevents diseases that would cost thousands to treat and cause lifelong suffering. That's leverage."

### The Core Principle

In any complex system, some interventions produce far greater results per unit of effort than others. The difference can be 10x, 100x, or 1000x. Finding leverage points is the difference between incremental progress and transformational impact.

### The Gates Foundation Methodology

1. **Decompose the system** - Break complexity into component subsystems
2. **Map the causal chains** - Understand how interventions flow through to outcomes
3. **Identify multiplication points** - Where does one unit of effort enable many units of outcome?
4. **Assess proven effectiveness** - What actually works (not what should work)?
5. **Calculate cost-effectiveness** - Impact per dollar/hour across options
6. **Focus ruthlessly** - Concentrate resources on highest-leverage interventions

## Types of Leverage

### Foundational Leverage
Interventions that make other interventions possible or more effective.
- **Example:** Gates Foundation's investment in disease surveillance—makes all other health interventions more targetable

### Multiplicative Leverage
Interventions where one input creates multiple outputs.
- **Example:** Teacher training—one trained teacher improves outcomes for hundreds of students over career

### Prevention Leverage
Interventions that stop expensive problems from occurring.
- **Example:** Vaccines—$3 prevents diseases costing $3,000+ to treat

### Network Leverage
Interventions that improve with adoption.
- **Example:** Platforms, standards, protocols—value increases as usage increases

### Compounding Leverage
Interventions whose benefits grow over time.
- **Example:** Education—learned skills enable further learning and higher earning

## Anti-Leverage Patterns (What to Avoid)

### The Spray and Pray
Spreading resources across too many interventions, none at effective scale.

### The Obvious Intervention
Focusing on the most visible problem rather than the highest-leverage point (often upstream and less visible).

### The Unproven Intervention
Choosing interventions that "should" work over interventions proven to work.

### The Comfortable Intervention
Choosing what you know how to do rather than what has highest impact.

### The Lone Wolf
Ignoring existing systems and trying to build from scratch when you could leverage existing infrastructure.

## Constraints

- Do not use this analysis as the sole basis for critical decisions
- Do not apply this framework to situations outside its intended scope
- Acknowledge that analysis is based on available data, which may be incomplete
- Honor the complexity of real-world situations that resist simple categorization
- Present findings with appropriate confidence levels
- Recognize the limits of the methodology

## Example

**Input:** "We're a mid-size company trying to reduce employee turnover. We have $200K annual budget for retention initiatives. Where's the leverage?"

**Output:**



**Why this works:**

This example demonstrates the key principles of the skill in action. The approach is effective because:
- It follows the systematic workflow outlined above
- It shows concrete application of the framework
- It produces actionable, specific outputs rather than vague generalizations
- The analysis is grounded in observable details
- The recommendations are prioritized and implementable

**Alternative applications:**

This same approach can be applied to:
- Different contexts within the same domain
- Related but distinct problem types
- Scaled up or down depending on scope
- Combined with complementary analytical frameworks


## Leverage Point Analysis

### System Overview
Employee retention system for a 500-person company with 22% annual turnover (above industry average of 15%).

### Desired Outcome
Reduce annual turnover from 22% to 15% or below, saving estimated $2.1M annually in replacement costs (based on $30K average replacement cost per employee).

### System Decomposition

**Component Subsystems:**
1. **Hiring** - Who joins, expectations set, role fit
2. **Onboarding** - Early experience, integration, ramp-up
3. **Management** - Day-to-day experience, feedback, growth
4. **Compensation** - Pay, benefits, equity
5. **Career Development** - Growth paths, learning, advancement
6. **Culture** - Values alignment, belonging, mission connection

**Causal Flow Map:**
```
Hiring (expectations) → Onboarding (early experience) → Management (daily reality)
                                                              ↓
                        Turnover Decision ← Career Path ← Engagement Level
```

### Intervention Analysis

**Candidate Interventions:**

| Intervention | Subsystem | Mechanism | Proven? |
|--------------|-----------|-----------|---------|
| Raise base salaries 5% | Compensation | Market competitiveness | Yes, moderate effect |
| Manager training program | Management | Better daily experience | Yes, high effect |
| Structured onboarding | Onboarding | Early success, integration | Yes, high effect |
| Career path documentation | Career Dev | Clarity on growth | Partially proven |
| Stay interviews | Management | Early warning, addressing concerns | Yes, moderate effect |
| Referral bonus increase | Hiring | Better-fit candidates | Partially proven |

### Leverage Assessment

**Multiplication Factor Analysis:**

| Intervention | Direct Impact | Multiplication Effect | Total Leverage |
|--------------|---------------|----------------------|----------------|
| Manager training | Managers improve | Each manager affects 8-12 reports | HIGH |
| Structured onboarding | New hires succeed | Sets trajectory for entire tenure | HIGH |
| Salary increase | Competitive pay | One-time effect, no multiplication | LOW |
| Career paths | Clarity on growth | Affects all, compounds over time | MEDIUM |
| Stay interviews | Catch issues early | Prevents individual departures | MEDIUM |

**Cost-Effectiveness Ranking:**

| Intervention | Cost | Expected Impact | Impact/Cost Ratio | Rank |
|--------------|------|-----------------|-------------------|------|
| Manager training | $60K | 4-6% turnover reduction | $10K per point | 1 |
| Structured onboarding | $40K | 2-3% turnover reduction | $15K per point | 2 |
| Stay interviews | $20K | 1-2% turnover reduction | $13K per point | 3 |
| Salary increase | $400K+ | 2-3% turnover reduction | $150K per point | 6 |

### Leverage Point Identification

**Primary Leverage Point: Manager Training and Development**

Research consistently shows: people leave managers, not companies. Gallup data indicates managers account for 70% of variance in employee engagement.

- **Mechanism:** Each manager touches 8-12 employees. Improving manager capabilities creates multiplication—one $5K investment in training affects many employee experiences
- **Evidence:** Companies with strong manager development see 22% lower turnover (Harvard Business Review meta-analysis)
- **Multiplication:** Skills compound—managers who improve continue improving team retention year over year

**Secondary Leverage Points:**

1. **Structured Onboarding (weeks 1-90)** - 20% of turnover happens in first 90 days. Strong onboarding is a proven leverage point where early investment shapes entire tenure trajectory.

2. **Stay Interviews at 6-month and 12-month marks** - Early warning system that catches issues when they're still addressable.

### Resource Allocation Recommendation

**Recommended Portfolio:**
| Intervention | Budget | Rationale |
|--------------|--------|-----------|
| Manager training program | $80K (40%) | Highest leverage, proven ROI |
| Structured onboarding redesign | $50K (25%) | High leverage in critical period |
| Stay interview program | $30K (15%) | Early warning and intervention |
| Career path documentation | $25K (12.5%) | Addresses growth concerns |
| Reserve for emergent issues | $15K (7.5%) | Flexibility for learnings |

### The Gates Verdict

The tempting answer is salary increases—it's visible and easy to implement. But the data shows it's the lowest-leverage intervention for retention. You'd spend $400K+ for the same impact you could get from $80K in manager development.

The highest-leverage point is management quality. One excellent manager retains more employees than $50K in salary bumps spread across the team. Invest in the multiplier.

The second leverage point is the onboarding period—you're losing 20% of departures in the first 90 days. That's preventable with structured onboarding investment. By the time someone's been here two years and leaves, they've made up their mind over months. But someone leaving at day 60? That's a system failure you can fix.

Focus resources on the multiplication points. $200K spent on managers and onboarding will outperform $200K spread across salary bumps, events, and perks.
