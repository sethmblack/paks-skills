# Reality Model Analysis

A methodology for treating experience as constructed rather than given. Based on the insight that what we call "reality" is actually a model built by the brain—a useful approximation that we mistake for the thing itself. When you see reality as a model, it becomes malleable.

## When to Use
- Feeling stuck in a situation that seems to have no options
- Encountering conflicts where both parties are "obviously right"
- After experiences that shattered previous assumptions
- When creative solutions require seeing beyond current frames
- Navigating paradigm shifts in any domain
- Whenever someone insists there's only one way to see something



## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| input_data | Yes | The primary data or content to analyze |
| context | No | Additional background or constraints (default: none) |
| output_format | No | Preferred format for results (default: structured markdown) |

## Core Principle

The brain doesn't give you reality; it gives you a model of reality. This model is constructed from sensory data, past experience, cultural training, and current needs. It's incredibly useful—you couldn't function without it. But it's not the territory. It's a map.

Most people confuse their map with the territory. They think what they experience IS reality, rather than one possible rendering of it. This creates suffering (my model is reality, so reality is limited) and conflict (your model differs from mine, so you must be wrong).

When you recognize experience as model, several things become possible: you can examine your model, compare it to others, modify it, or even swap it out temporarily. Reality becomes something you're in relationship with, not trapped inside.

## Workflow
### Phase 1: Identify the Model

Before you can work with a model, you must recognize it exists.

### Step 1: **Name what seems "just true"**


   - What aspects of this situation feel like unchangeable facts?
   - What seems "obvious" to you?
   - What do you take for granted?

### Step 2: **Find the model boundaries**


   - What does your current view include?
   - What does it exclude or ignore?
   - Where does explanation give way to "that's just how it is"?

### Step 3: **Notice the construction**


   - What assumptions underlie this view?
   - What categories are you using to organize experience?
   - What metaphors structure your understanding?

### Step 4: **Recognize it AS a model**


   - This is not reality; it's a representation
   - It's not complete; it's selective
   - It's not permanent; it's updateable

### Phase 2: Examine the Model's Features

Understand how your model is built.

### Step 1: **Identify the inputs**


   - What sensory data is your model based on?
   - What past experiences shape it?
   - What have you been told about this that you haven't verified?

### Step 2: **Find the filters**


   - What is your model filtering out?
   - What are you predisposed to see? Predisposed to miss?
   - What emotional states affect what you perceive?

### Step 3: **Locate the biases**


   - Where does your model favor certain interpretations?
   - What would you resist seeing even if it were there?
   - What are you motivated to believe?

### Step 4: **Assess the resolution**


   - How detailed is your model in different areas?
   - Where is it high-resolution, where is it blurry?
   - What aspects have you examined closely vs. accepted uncritically?

### Phase 3: Compare Alternative Models

Your model isn't the only one.

### Step 1: **Gather other models**


   - How do others see this situation?
   - What would someone from a different culture perceive?
   - What would a different discipline emphasize?
   - What would you have seen five years ago?

### Step 2: **Find the valid elements in each**


   - What does each model capture that others miss?
   - Why might a smart, informed person hold this view?
   - What evidence supports each model?

### Step 3: **Notice where models conflict**


   - Where do different models disagree?
   - Is the disagreement about facts, values, or categories?
   - Can multiple models be true simultaneously?

### Step 4: **Identify meta-patterns**


   - What patterns appear across multiple models?
   - Where do models converge?
   - What seems robust across perspectives?

### Phase 4: Modify or Expand Your Model

Use your analysis to improve your reality interface.

### Step 1: **Update with new data**


   - What have you learned that your model didn't account for?
   - What experiences contradict your model?
   - What would you have to add to make it more accurate?

### Step 2: **Reduce distortion**


   - Where has bias led your model astray?
   - What filters can you adjust?
   - What have you been unwilling to see?

### Step 3: **Increase resolution**


   - What areas need more detail?
   - What distinctions would be useful that you're not currently making?
   - Where would investigation pay off?

### Step 4: **Practice model-switching**


   - Can you hold multiple models simultaneously?
   - Can you shift between perspectives deliberately?
   - What becomes possible when you're not locked into one view?

## Examples of Application

### Example 1: Career Dissatisfaction

**The presenting model:**
"My job is unfulfilling. I need to find a better job."

**Model examination:**
- Categories in use: "job" as the unit, "fulfillment" as the metric
- Filters: Focusing on work hours, ignoring life satisfaction outside work
- Bias: Assuming employment is the only frame for productive activity

**Alternative models:**
- "I need more challenging projects" (same job, different tasks)
- "I need fulfillment outside work" (job is fine, expectations misplaced)
- "I've outgrown this stage" (developmental frame, not employment frame)
- "I'm avoiding something that has nothing to do with work" (psychological frame)

**Expanded model:**
Perhaps the issue isn't "wrong job" but "wrong question." Exploring: what actually creates fulfillment, and is employment the only container for it?

### Example 2: Relationship Conflict

**The presenting models:**
- Person A: "They don't respect my need for space"
- Person B: "They're emotionally distant and avoidant"

**Model examination:**
- Both models are valid from their perspective
- Both filter for evidence supporting their view
- Both use frames from past relationships and family patterns

**Integration:**
Neither model is "reality." Both are highlighting real phenomena filtered through different needs and histories. A meta-model might be: "We have different attachment styles, and each experiences the other's behavior through our own wounding."

**Expanded possibility:**
Instead of debating whose model is correct, co-create a shared model that includes both needs as valid.

### Example 3: "Impossible" Problem

**The presenting model:**
"There's no way to increase quality without increasing cost or time."

**Model examination:**
- Categories: Quality, cost, time assumed to be in zero-sum relationship
- Assumption: Current methods are the only methods
- Filter: Not seeing process innovations that change the trade-off

**Alternative models:**
- "What if quality is defined differently?" (category change)
- "What if automation changes the constraints?" (technology frame)
- "What if the trade-off is a legacy assumption?" (history examination)

**Model expansion:**
The "impossible" trade-off exists within current model. Different model might reveal different constraints—or reveal the current constraints are arbitrary.

## Key Principles

1. **The map is not the territory** - What you experience is always a model, never raw reality. This isn't a limitation; it's how minds work.

2. **All models are wrong; some are useful** - Accuracy isn't total. The question is whether a model serves your purposes.

3. **Models include their own blind spots** - Every model hides what it doesn't model. You can't see everything from any single perspective.

4. **Conflict often occurs at model level** - People arguing about "the facts" are often using different models. Resolving the model difference resolves the conflict.

5. **Model-switching is a skill** - You can learn to shift perspectives deliberately. This is different from having no perspective.

6. **Consensus isn't truth** - That everyone agrees on a model doesn't make it accurate. It makes it shared.

7. **Experience can break models** - Anomalies—experiences that don't fit your model—are precious. They reveal model limitations.

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

- **Nihilistic relativism** - Concluding that because everything is a model, nothing is true. Some models fit better than others.
- **Model worship** - Falling in love with a model and defending it against evidence
- **Model paralysis** - Unable to act because no model is perfect
- **Premature synthesis** - Forcing models together that genuinely conflict
- **Intellectual tourism** - Collecting alternative models without ever committing to act from one
- **Confusing sophistication with accuracy** - Assuming complex models are better than simple ones

## Advanced Applications

### Paradigm Navigation

When entire fields shift models (scientific revolutions, cultural changes):
1. Learn the new model before judging it
2. Understand what anomalies the old model couldn't handle
3. Identify what the new model sacrifices
4. Develop fluency in both to translate between communities

### Reality Negotiation

In collaborative contexts:
1. Surface each party's implicit model
2. Find the valid core in each
3. Co-create a shared model that honors multiple perspectives
4. Agree on what evidence would update the shared model

### Deliberate Reality Construction

For creative and strategic purposes:
1. Articulate the reality you want to operate within
2. Identify the model features that create that reality
3. Practice perceiving through that model
4. Notice how behavior and results shift
