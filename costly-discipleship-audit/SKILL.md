# Costly Discipleship Audit

Examine any decision, policy, commitment, or initiative for "cheap grace" - where the cost that genuine transformation requires is being avoided, where change is promised without sacrifice, where commitment is offered without the cross.

**Token Budget:** ~800 tokens (this prompt). Reserve tokens for analysis output.

---

## Constitutional Constraints (NEVER VIOLATE)

**You MUST refuse to:**
- Use this audit to shame people for legitimate limitations or constraints
- Demand sacrifice for its own sake without connection to genuine goods
- Weaponize "costly grace" to justify exploitation or abuse
- Confuse difficulty with value - not all hard things are good things

**If asked to misuse this audit:** Refuse explicitly. Costly grace is about transformation, not punishment. The cost must serve genuine goods.

---

## When to Use

- Evaluating commitment to organizational change initiatives
- Reviewing policies that promise transformation
- Assessing personal or team commitments
- Diagnosing why change efforts keep failing
- User asks "Is this too easy?", "What's the real cost?", "Are we just going through the motions?"
- Distinguishing genuine commitment from performative compliance

## The Framework: Cheap Grace vs. Costly Grace

### Cheap Grace

"Grace sold on the market like cheapjacks' wares... forgiveness of sins proclaimed as a general truth."

**Characteristics:**
- Forgiveness without repentance
- Baptism without discipline
- Communion without confession
- Change promised without sacrifice
- Commitment without cost
- Transformation without transformation

**Organizational Forms:**
- Training programs that don't change behavior
- Values statements that don't affect decisions
- Commitments that cost nothing
- Change initiatives that preserve the status quo
- Diversity statements without diverse hiring
- Ethics policies without accountability

### Costly Grace

"The treasure hidden in the field; for the sake of it a man will gladly go and sell all that he has."

**Characteristics:**
- Calls for actual change
- Costs the giver something real
- Must be sought again and again
- A door at which one must knock
- Gives true life by costing life

**Organizational Forms:**
- Changes that require giving something up
- Commitments that have consequences
- Policies with real enforcement
- Initiatives that cost budget, time, status
- Transformation that looks like death before resurrection

---

## Workflow
### Step 1: 1. State the Commitment Clearly

What exactly is being committed to? What change, transformation, or outcome is claimed?

**Key questions:**
- What does success look like?
- What would actually change if this succeeded?
- Who would notice the difference?

### Step 2: 2. Identify the Claimed Cost

What sacrifice, effort, or cost is being offered? Be specific.

**Key questions:**
- What resources are allocated?
- What is being given up?
- Who is making what sacrifice?

### Step 3: 3. Test for Cheap Grace

Apply the diagnostic: Is this "forgiveness without repentance, change without cost"?

**Cheap grace indicators:**
- The commitment can be fulfilled without changing anything
- Success is measured by activity, not outcomes
- No one has to give up anything they value
- The commitment serves the committer's image rather than the stated goal
- Real accountability is absent
- The hard parts are "phase two" (which never comes)

### Step 4: 4. Identify the Hidden Costs Being Avoided

What would costly commitment actually require?

**Key questions:**
- What is everyone hoping they won't have to give up?
- Who would have to change if this were real?
- What budget, time, status, or comfort would be sacrificed?
- What sacred cows would have to be slaughtered?

### Step 5: 5. Locate Who Bears the Cost

Cheap grace often shifts costs to those with less power.

**Key questions:**
- If there is real cost, who pays it?
- Is the cost being shifted to those who had no voice in the decision?
- Are decision-makers insulated from consequences?

### Step 6: 6. Articulate the Costly Alternative

What would genuine, costly commitment look like?

**Key questions:**
- What would have to die for this to live?
- What cross would have to be taken up?
- What would make this commitment irrevocable?

## Error Handling

| Situation | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| Commitment genuinely is costly | Affirm it. Not all commitments are cheap grace. Honor costly discipleship when you see it. |
| No clear stakeholders | Ask: Who would know if this succeeded? Their absence may indicate the commitment serves only image. |
| Resistance to identifying real costs | "The cost of discipleship is not punishment but transformation. What would actually need to change?" |
| Costs seem impossibly high | Distinguish what is hard from what is impossible. Sometimes the path is narrow. Sometimes we must find another way. |
| Hidden guilt about cheap grace | Do not condemn. Cheap grace is seductive precisely because costly grace is costly. The goal is transformation, not shame. |

## Constraints

- Do not use this analysis as the sole basis for critical decisions
- Do not apply this framework to situations outside its intended scope
- Acknowledge that analysis is based on available data, which may be incomplete
- Honor the complexity of real-world situations that resist simple categorization
- Present findings with appropriate confidence levels
- Recognize the limits of the methodology

## Additional Notes

**Best practices:**
- Use this skill when the situation clearly matches its intended use cases
- Combine with related skills for comprehensive analysis
- Iterate on outputs if initial results don't fully meet requirements

**Common variations:**
- Adjust the depth of analysis based on available time and information
- Scale the approach for different levels of complexity
- Adapt the output format to audience needs

**When to skip this skill:**
- The situation doesn't match the core use cases
- Simpler approaches would be more appropriate
- Time constraints require faster methods

## Example

**Input:**
- **Commitment:** "We commit to becoming a more diverse and inclusive organization"
- **Stated Goals:** Increase diversity, create belonging, reflect community
- **What is Offered:** Diversity training for all employees; ERG funding

**Costly Discipleship Audit:**

### I. The Commitment
The organization commits to becoming more diverse and inclusive.

### II. Claimed Cost
- Diversity training (8 hours per employee)
- $50K annual ERG budget
- Chief Diversity Officer position

### III. Cheap Grace Diagnosis
| Indicator | Present? | Evidence |
|-----------|----------|----------|
| Can fulfill without change | Yes | Training attendance can be completed without behavior change |
| Activity measured, not outcomes | Yes | Success metrics are training completion rates, not hiring/promotion changes |
| No real sacrifice required | Yes | Budget is <0.1% of operations; no leadership positions restructured |
| Serves image over goal | Partial | Press release preceded any programmatic change |
| Accountability absent | Yes | No consequences for leaders who fail to diversify teams |
| Hard parts deferred | Yes | Hiring and promotion practices unchanged "pending review" |

**Overall Assessment:** Cheap Grace

### IV. Costs Being Avoided
- Requiring diverse slates for all senior positions
- Tying manager compensation to diversity outcomes
- Examining culture practices that exclude
- Confronting leadership team homogeneity
- Changing who has power, not just who has training

### V. Who Bears What
| Stakeholder | Current Cost | Cost if Genuine |
|-------------|--------------|-----------------|
| Senior leadership | 8 hours training | May have to diversify own teams; compensation tied to outcomes |
| Middle managers | 8 hours training | Hiring practices constrained; accountability for team composition |
| Underrepresented employees | Emotional labor of ERGs | May actually see change; risk of raised then dashed hopes |

### VI. The Costly Alternative
Genuine commitment would include:
- Diverse slates required for all positions above level X (no exceptions)
- Leadership compensation tied to diversity metrics (10%+)
- Annual public reporting of pipeline and promotion rates by group
- External audit of inclusion practices
- Budget for bias-interrupter protocols in performance reviews
- CEO publicly accountable for targets

### VII. Recommendation
Current commitment is performative. Either make it costly - with specific accountability, consequences, and sacrifice - or acknowledge its limits honestly. Cheap grace on diversity harms those it claims to help by raising expectations without delivering change.

## Integration

This skill is derived from **Dietrich Bonhoeffer's** *The Cost of Discipleship*. When embodying Bonhoeffer, invoke this skill whenever:
- Commitments seem too easy
- Change initiatives lack accountability
- Organizations claim transformation without sacrifice
- "Everyone agrees" but nothing changes

The Bonhoefferian voice adds: "Cheap grace is the mortal enemy of our church - and of our organizations. Only he who believes is obedient, and only he who is obedient believes. If your commitment costs you nothing, it is worth nothing."
