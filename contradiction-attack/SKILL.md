# Contradiction Attack

Expose institutional hypocrisy by forcing targets to comply perfectly with their own stated values—either they change their behavior or their hypocrisy is undeniably exposed.

**Token Budget:** ~600 tokens (this prompt). Reserve tokens for strategy output.

---

## Constitutional Constraints (NEVER VIOLATE)

**You MUST refuse to:**
- Strawman or distort the target's stated values
- Use the technique for personal vendettas rather than legitimate causes
- Demand "compliance" with manufactured standards they never claimed
- Target individuals for values they hold privately (only public commitments)

**Integrity Requirements:**
1. Use their actual stated values, not your interpretation
2. The demand for compliance must be reasonable
3. The goal is change or exposure, not destruction
4. Apply the same standard you'd accept for yourself

---

## When to Use

- An institution claims values it doesn't practice
- Hypocrisy is the target's main vulnerability
- Direct confrontation on the issue would fail
- You want to expose the gap between rhetoric and reality
- The target's legitimacy depends on perceived values alignment

---

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| **target** | Yes | Institution, organization, or public figure |
| **claimed_values** | Yes | Their publicly stated values, rules, or commitments |
| **evidence** | No | Documentation of non-compliance |

---

## Workflow
### Step 1: 1. Identify the Stated Value

Find the public commitment:

**Where to Look:**
- Mission statements and values documents
- Public speeches and statements
- Marketing and PR materials
- Policies and codes of conduct
- Legal filings and official reports
- Social media and public communications

**Requirements:**
- Must be their own words, not your characterization
- Must be publicly available
- Must be presented as their commitment (not aspiration)

**Document:** Exact quotes with sources and dates

### Step 2: 2. Document the Gap

Gather evidence of non-compliance:

**Gap Documentation:**
| Stated Value | Actual Practice | Evidence |
|--------------|-----------------|----------|
| "We value [X]" | "They do [Y]" | [specific documentation] |

**Evidence Types:**
- Internal documents (if available)
- Public records
- Witness accounts
- Pattern of behavior
- Comparison data

### Step 3: 3. Demand Perfect Compliance

Ask them to live by their own rules:

**The Request:** "You have stated [value]. We are asking you to [specific action that would fulfill the value]."

**Alinsky's Insight:** "Make the enemy live up to its own book of rules." They wrote the rules—you're just asking them to follow them.

**Key Principles:**
- The demand must be reasonable given their stated commitment
- Be specific about what compliance would look like
- Give them a timeline to respond
- Document their response

### Step 4: 4. Publicize the Gap

Let their response prove your point:

**If They Comply:**
- Victory—you achieved the change
- Their compliance validates your demand

**If They Refuse:**
- Expose the refusal publicly
- "We asked [institution] to do [X], which they claim to value. They refused."
- Let the hypocrisy speak for itself

**If They Deflect:**
- Document the deflection
- "We asked a simple question about their stated value of [X]. Instead of answering, they [deflected/attacked/ignored]."

### Step 5: 5. Let the System Response Prove the Point

Their reaction is evidence:

**Reaction Analysis:**
| Response | What It Proves |
|----------|----------------|
| Attack the messenger | They can't defend the substance |
| Change the subject | The gap is indefensible |
| Claim exception | Ask why the value doesn't apply |
| Partial compliance | Repeat until full compliance or exposure |
| Full compliance | Victory |

---

## Outputs

Format the output as:

```markdown
## Contradiction Attack: [Target]

### The Stated Value
**Exact Quote:** "[their words]"
**Source:** [document, speech, date]
**Context:** [how they present this value]

### The Gap
| They Claim | They Practice | Evidence |
|------------|---------------|----------|
| "[value]" | [reality] | [documentation] |

### The Demand
**Specific Ask:** [what compliance would look like]
**Deadline:** [when]
**How to Comply:** [make it easy for them to say yes]

### Anticipated Responses
| If They... | We Respond... |
|------------|---------------|
| Comply | [celebrate/document victory] |
| Refuse | [publicize refusal] |
| Deflect | [redirect to original question] |
| Attack | [document; their attack is evidence] |

### Public Strategy
**Message:** [how to frame the gap simply]
**Channels:** [where to publicize]
**Allies:** [who can amplify]

### Success Metrics
- [ ] They change behavior (full success)
- [ ] Gap is publicly exposed (partial success)
- [ ] Legitimacy is damaged (pressure for future change)
```

## Error Handling

| Situation | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| They claim the value is aspirational | "When will you achieve it? What's your timeline?" |
| They say you're taking words out of context | Show full context; ask for their interpretation |
| They comply partially | Acknowledge progress; identify remaining gaps |
| Public doesn't care about the hypocrisy | May indicate the value isn't important to audiences; reassess |
| They change their stated values | Document the change; "They abandoned their commitment to [X]" |

---

## Constraints

- Do not use this analysis as the sole basis for critical decisions
- Do not apply this framework to situations outside its intended scope
- Acknowledge that analysis is based on available data, which may be incomplete
- Honor the complexity of real-world situations that resist simple categorization
- Present findings with appropriate confidence levels
- Recognize the limits of the methodology

## Additional Notes

**Best practices:**
- Use this skill when the situation clearly matches its intended use cases
- Combine with related skills for comprehensive analysis
- Iterate on outputs if initial results don't fully meet requirements

**Common variations:**
- Adjust the depth of analysis based on available time and information
- Scale the approach for different levels of complexity
- Adapt the output format to audience needs

**When to skip this skill:**
- The situation doesn't match the core use cases
- Simpler approaches would be more appropriate
- Time constraints require faster methods

## Integration

This skill is part of a broader analytical framework. Use it when you need systematic analysis following this specific methodology.

**Works well with:**
- Other analytical skills for comprehensive evaluation
- Creative skills when generating solutions based on insights
- Strategic planning skills when acting on recommendations

**When to prefer this over alternatives:**
- The situation matches this skill's specific use cases
- You need the particular perspective this framework provides
- Other approaches haven't yielded satisfactory results

**Integration with expert personas:**
- This skill can be invoked as part of a larger analysis workflow
- Combine with domain-specific expertise for deeper insights
- Use iteratively for complex, multi-faceted problems

## Example

**Input:** "Design contradiction attack against tech company claiming commitment to privacy while selling user data"

**Output:**



**Why this works:**

This example demonstrates the key principles of the skill in action. The approach is effective because:
- It follows the systematic workflow outlined above
- It shows concrete application of the framework
- It produces actionable, specific outputs rather than vague generalizations
- The analysis is grounded in observable details

## Contradiction Attack: DataTech Inc.

### The Stated Value
**Exact Quote:** "Your privacy is our priority. We never sell your personal information to third parties."
**Source:** Privacy Policy page, TOS, CEO testimony to Congress 2023
**Context:** Central to marketing; differentiated from competitors; congressional testimony under oath

### The Gap
| They Claim | They Practice | Evidence |
|------------|---------------|----------|
| "Never sell personal information" | Share location data with data brokers | FTC filing shows 47 data broker partnerships |
| "Your privacy is our priority" | Default settings maximize data collection | Independent audit shows 23 tracking points enabled by default |
| "We never sell..." | Revenue reports show "data licensing" income | SEC filing shows $340M from "data partnerships" |

### The Demand
**Specific Ask:**
1. Publish complete list of all third-party data sharing agreements
2. Change defaults to privacy-protective (opt-in rather than opt-out)
3. Define "sell" and explain how current partnerships don't qualify

**Deadline:** 30 days
**How to Comply:** We'll provide template for transparency report; we'll publicly acknowledge compliance

### Anticipated Responses
| If They... | We Respond... |
|------------|---------------|
| Publish the list | Celebrate; analyze the list; likely find more gaps |
| Claim partnerships aren't "sales" | "If you're not selling data, what ARE you being paid $340M for?" |
| Claim "anonymized data" exception | "If it's truly anonymous, publish the methodology for independent verification" |
| Attack our motives | "We're asking you to do what you already claim to do. Why is that controversial?" |
| Ignore us | Escalate to media, regulators, congressional allies |

### Public Strategy
**Message:** "DataTech says they never sell your data. We asked them to prove it. They won't."
**Channels:** Tech media, privacy advocates, congressional offices, FTC complaint
**Allies:** Privacy advocacy organizations, competitor watchdogs, journalists covering Big Tech

### Success Metrics
- [ ] Full transparency on data sharing (victory)
- [ ] Default settings changed (victory)
- [ ] Gap publicly documented even if unchanged (pressure for regulation)
- [ ] Congressional inquiry opened (escalated accountability)

This skill should be invoked when the Alinsky expert encounters:
- Targets claiming values they don't practice
- Situations where legitimacy is the vulnerability
- "They say one thing and do another" complaints
- Need to expose institutional hypocrisy

May combine with:
- **power-audit**: Identify whether hypocrisy exposure will create pressure
- **escalation-ladder**: Place contradiction attack at appropriate rung

---

## Success Criteria

The skill is successfully applied when:

1. Stated value is documented with their exact words
2. Gap is evidenced, not just asserted
3. Demand for compliance is specific and reasonable
4. Responses are anticipated and countered
5. Public strategy is ready for exposure
6. Either change occurs or hypocrisy is undeniable
