# Strategic Entrance Design

Design first impressions and initial presentations that establish favorable frames for relationships, negotiations, or new situations.

---

## When to Use

- Preparing for an important first meeting (investor, client, executive)
- Starting a new role or joining a new team
- Launching a product, initiative, or campaign
- Beginning a negotiation or partnership discussion
- Any situation where first impressions will shape future dynamics

---

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| context | Yes | The meeting, relationship, or situation you're entering |
| audience | Yes | Who you need to impress and their likely expectations |
| your_assets | No | Your strengths, resources, and unique offerings (will be surfaced if not provided) |
| desired_frame | No | How you want the relationship to be perceived going forward |

---

## The Five-Step Framework

### Step 1: Analyze the Expected Frame

Before you can subvert expectations, understand them:
- What does this audience typically expect in this situation?
- What frame would be established if you arrived "normally"?
- What assumptions will they make if you don't actively shape perception?

**Cleopatra's insight:** "Antony expected a client queen arriving to answer his summons. Had I arrived as expected, I would have been treated as expected - a subordinate reporting to her superior. The expected frame must be identified before it can be transformed."

### Step 2: Identify Your Strategic Assets

What do you bring that distinguishes you?
- Unique capabilities, knowledge, or resources
- Symbols of authority, success, or legitimacy
- Stories, credentials, or demonstrations
- Allies, endorsements, or social proof

**Key question:** What do you have that they need or cannot easily find elsewhere?

### Step 3: Design the Setting and Timing

Control what you can:
- **Location:** Can you propose a setting that elevates you? Your office, a neutral impressive venue, a demonstration environment?
- **Timing:** When are they most receptive? When are you strongest?
- **Format:** Meeting, presentation, demonstration, dinner? What format showcases your strengths?

**Cleopatra's insight:** "Do not accept their venue, their timing, their format without consideration. Every element you control is an element working for you rather than against you."

### Step 4: Craft the Opening Moment

The first 30 seconds establish everything:
- What visual impression do you create?
- What are your first words? (Not weather or traffic)
- What frame do you establish immediately?
- How do you signal partnership rather than supplication?

**Avoid:** Arriving as a petitioner. Even if you need something, arrive as someone offering something.

### Step 5: Plan the Frame Establishment

Within the first five minutes, establish:
- Why this meeting benefits both parties
- What you uniquely bring to the table
- The relationship dynamic going forward
- Your authority and capability (shown, not told)

## Workflow

### Step 1: Gather and Review Inputs

Collect all relevant information:
- Review the provided data and context
- Identify key parameters and constraints
- Clarify any ambiguities or missing information
- Establish success criteria

### Step 2: Analyze the Situation

Perform systematic analysis:
- Identify patterns and relationships
- Evaluate against established frameworks
- Consider multiple perspectives
- Document key findings

### Step 3: Generate Recommendations

Create actionable outputs:
- Synthesize insights from analysis
- Prioritize recommendations by impact
- Ensure recommendations are specific and measurable
- Consider implementation feasibility

## Output Format

### Elements to Include

## Constraints

- Do not recommend deception or false credentials
- Do not suggest presentations you cannot authentically deliver
- Consider the audience's perspective - manipulation breeds resentment
- Balance impression management with genuine substance
- Remember: you must deliver on whatever frame you establish

---

## Outputs

**Primary Output:** A structured analysis document that identifies and articulates patterns, insights, and actionable recommendations based on the input data.

**Format:**
```markdown
## Analysis: [Topic]

### Key Findings
- [Finding 1]
- [Finding 2]
- [Finding 3]

### Recommendations
1. [Action 1]
2. [Action 2]
3. [Action 3]
```

**Example output:** See the Example section below for a complete demonstration.

## Example

**Input:** "I'm a first-time founder meeting with a prestigious VC firm. They have all the power - they see 100 founders a week. How do I stand out?"

**Output:**



**Why this works:**

This example demonstrates the key principles of the skill in action. The approach is effective because:
- It follows the systematic workflow outlined above
- It shows concrete application of the framework
- It produces actionable, specific outputs rather than vague generalizations
- The analysis is grounded in observable details
- The recommendations are prioritized and implementable

**Alternative applications:**

This same approach can be applied to:
- Different contexts within the same domain
- Related but distinct problem types
- Scaled up or down depending on scope
- Combined with complementary analytical frameworks


## Strategic Entrance Design

### Expected Frame
Another hopeful founder seeking their validation and money. Slightly nervous, overly prepared slides, eager to please, grateful for the meeting.

### Target Frame
A capable operator who has built something valuable and is evaluating whether this firm deserves to be part of it. Partnership of mutual selection.

### Your Strategic Assets
- **Your specific insight:** You know something about this market they don't
- **Traction/momentum:** Whatever proves people want this
- **Team credibility:** Why you specifically will win
- **Vision clarity:** Where this goes that's bigger than current metrics

### Setting Recommendations
- **Location:** Accept their office (standard), but consider if you can offer a demo at your space or with a customer
- **Timing:** Request morning when they're fresh; avoid Friday afternoon
- **Format:** If possible, demonstration over presentation. Showing beats telling.

### The Opening
**Visual impression:** Calm confidence. Not nervous energy. You've built something that works.
**First words:** "Before we start - I'd like to understand what you're specifically looking for in this space. I want to make sure I'm addressing your actual questions, not giving you the same pitch everyone else does."
**First 30 seconds:** You're interviewing them as much as they're interviewing you. Frame established.

### Frame Establishment (First 5 Minutes)
1. Understand their thesis and interest first (shows you value their perspective, positions you as peer)
2. Share one specific insight that surprises them (demonstrates you know something they don't)
3. Let traction speak through a brief story, not metrics dump (shows rather than tells)

### Elements to Include
- One question that shows you've researched their portfolio deeply
- A brief story of a customer/user that reveals product-market fit
- Evidence of why YOU are the right person (not just the idea)
- A question about what they'd need to see to move forward (invites them to sell you)

### Elements to Avoid
- Starting with "Thank you so much for your time" (positions as supplicant)
- Launching immediately into your deck (follows their format)
- Defensive energy when they push back (signals insecurity)
- Asking "What questions do you have?" (hands over control)
