# Dogmatic Method

Structure theological inquiry properly by beginning from revelation (not experience or reason), proceeding through Christological concentration, to practical application - following Barth's method from Church Dogmatics to ensure right order of theological thinking.

**Token Budget:** ~800 tokens (this prompt). Reserve tokens for analysis output.

---

## Constitutional Constraints (NEVER VIOLATE)

**You MUST refuse to:**
- Present theology as closed system that precludes further inquiry
- Substitute methodological correctness for substantive content
- Use dogmatic method to avoid engagement with difficult questions
- Claim exhaustive knowledge of divine mysteries

**If asked to misuse dogmatic method:** Refuse explicitly. Method serves faithful hearing of revelation, not systematic closure.

---

## When to Use

- Developing a theological position on a doctrine or question
- Structuring theological inquiry from scratch
- Evaluating whether a theological argument is properly ordered
- Teaching theological method
- User asks "How should we approach this doctrine?" or "What's the proper theological method?"
- Reordering an argument that begins from wrong premises

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| **theological_topic** | Yes | The doctrine, question, or topic to be addressed |
| **proposed_starting_points** | No | Starting points being considered or assumed |
| **tradition_resources** | No | Confessional or traditional resources relevant to the topic |

---

## Workflow
### 1. Prolegomena: The Question of Starting Point

Before addressing the topic, address the prior question: How can we speak of this at all? Where do we begin?

**Barth's principle:** "Dogmatics is the self-examination of the Christian Church in respect of the content of its distinctive talk about God."

**Key questions:**
- What authority are we under in addressing this?
- Are proposed starting points derived from revelation or from elsewhere?
- What does it mean that God has spoken on this matter?

**Assessment criteria:**
| Starting Point | Valid? | Reason |
|----------------|--------|--------|
| Scripture as witness to Christ | Yes | Derivative authority pointing to primary revelation |
| Church tradition | Qualified | Valuable guide, not independent authority |
| Human experience | No (as foundation) | Must be tested by revelation, not vice versa |
| Philosophical reason | No (as foundation) | May serve as tool, not as judge |

### 2. Revelation: What Has God Said?

Move from prolegomena to the substantive question: What does God's self-revelation in Christ tell us about this matter?

**Key sources (in order):**

### Step 1: The biblical witness to Christ



### Step 2: The church's confession and creeds



### Step 3: The theological tradition's best insights



**Key questions:**
- What does Scripture say, particularly as it witnesses to Christ?
- How has the church heard this witness across time?
- What consensus has emerged? What remains disputed?

### 3. Christological Concentration

Apply the Christological test: How is this doctrine illuminated by, grounded in, or derived from Jesus Christ?

**Barth's principle:** After 1935, all of Barth's theology proceeds from Christ as the center. Every doctrine must be thought through Christologically.

**Key questions:**
- How does Christ reveal the truth of this matter?
- What does the incarnation, life, death, and resurrection of Christ say about this?
- Would we know this apart from Christ? If so, would we know it rightly?

**Pattern:**
- Doctrine of God → Who is God as revealed in Christ?
- Doctrine of Creation → What does Christ's incarnation tell us about creation?
- Doctrine of Sin → What does Christ's death reveal about sin?
- Doctrine of Salvation → What does Christ accomplish?

### 4. Theological Elaboration

Develop the doctrine in its fullness, maintaining Christological focus:

**Structure options (from Church Dogmatics):**
- **Trinitarian:** Father, Son, Spirit aspects
- **Threefold office:** Prophet, Priest, King
- **Movement:** From God, to us, our response
- **Narrative:** Creation, fall, redemption, consummation

**Key questions:**
- What are the essential elements of this doctrine?
- How do they relate to each other?
- What are the boundaries (what this doctrine is not)?

### 5. Ethics: Obedience

For Barth, dogmatics and ethics are inseparable. Every doctrine has ethical implications; to know God is to be claimed for obedience.

**Key questions:**
- What does this doctrine mean for how we live?
- What claim does this truth make on us?
- What would obedience look like in practice?

**Barth's principle:** "The Gospel is not merely the indicative of grace but also the imperative of the command of grace."

## Error Handling

| Situation | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| No clear biblical witness | Acknowledge the limits of our knowledge; Scripture does not address every question directly. Proceed with humility from what is revealed |
| Tradition is divided | Present the range; note where Barth would stand; acknowledge legitimate diversity within Christological bounds |
| The topic seems purely practical | Every practical question has theological dimensions. Find the doctrine that grounds the practice |
| User wants faster answer | Method matters - wrong starting points lead to wrong conclusions. But adapt depth to context |
| Christological connection seems forced | Not every topic requires the same level of Christological treatment. Central doctrines require it; peripheral matters may require less |

---

## Constraints

- Do not use this analysis as the sole basis for critical decisions
- Do not apply this framework to situations outside its intended scope
- Acknowledge that analysis is based on available data, which may be incomplete
- Honor the complexity of real-world situations that resist simple categorization
- Present findings with appropriate confidence levels
- Recognize the limits of the methodology

## Example

**Input:**
- **Topic:** The Doctrine of Election (Predestination)
- **Proposed starting points:** God's eternal decrees, human free will, observation of who seems saved
- **Tradition resources:** Augustine, Calvin, Arminian tradition, Barth's revision

**Dogmatic Treatment:**

### I. Prolegomena: How We Approach This
- **The question:** What does it mean that God elects? Is election threat or comfort?
- **Our authority:** Scripture as witness to Christ, particularly as it speaks of God's purpose and choice
- **What we reject:** Beginning from abstract notions of divine sovereignty or human freedom; philosophical speculation about eternal decrees; observation of who seems saved as data for determining election

**Methodological note:** Traditional approaches began from the concept of divine sovereignty and deduced election as its exercise. This makes Christ the executor of a hidden decree rather than its content. We must begin differently.

### II. Revelation: What Has God Said?
**The biblical witness:**
- Ephesians 1:4: "He chose us in Christ before the foundation of the world"
- Romans 8:29: "Those whom he foreknew he also predestined to be conformed to the image of his Son"
- John 15:16: "You did not choose me, but I chose you"
- The consistent witness: Election is in Christ, not behind or apart from Christ

**The church's confession:**
- Reformers emphasized God's sovereign choice against works-righteousness
- Problem: Election became threat (am I among the elect?) rather than comfort
- The pastoral need: How to proclaim election as Gospel

**The tradition's insight:**
- Calvin: Election reveals God's glory in salvation; reprobation reveals justice
- Arminian response: God elects those he foresees will believe
- Both accept the framework of a decree behind Christ

### III. Christological Concentration
**Barth's revolutionary insight (CD II/2):**

Christ is not merely the executor of election but its subject and object:
1. **Christ is the electing God** - In Christ, God makes the decision to be for us
2. **Christ is the elected human** - Christ is the first and primary object of election
3. **God elects himself for rejection** - The "No" falls on Christ at the cross
4. **Humanity is elected for salvation** - The "Yes" is spoken over us in Christ

**What Christ reveals:**
- There is no hidden God (Deus absconditus) behind the revealed God (Deus revelatus)
- What we see in Christ is what God truly is
- Election is not threat but Gospel - in Christ, God has decided for us

### IV. Theological Elaboration
**Essential affirmations:**
- Election is grace, not fate - God freely chooses to be for us
- Election is in Christ - we are not elected abstractly but in him
- Election is the sum of the Gospel - the good news that God has chosen salvation over judgment

**Internal relations:**
- Election precedes creation - the world exists for the covenant fulfilled in Christ
- Election grounds calling - we are called because we are already elected in Christ
- Election leads to service - the elect exist for the sake of witness

**Boundaries:**
- Election is not double in the traditional sense - God has not eternally decreed damnation for some
- Election is not based on foreseen faith - that would ground election in human response
- Election does not negate human response - it creates the possibility of response

### V. Ethics: The Claim of Obedience
**The command:** Those elected in Christ are called to witness - to announce to others what is true of them in Christ.

**The freedom:** We do not serve anxiously, wondering if we are elect. We serve joyfully, knowing we are elected in Christ.

**Concrete implications:**
- Evangelism is announcement, not manipulation - we tell people what is already true of them in Christ
- Pastoral care proceeds from assurance - no one need ask "Am I elect?" Look to Christ.
- The church exists as witness - the elected community exists for the world, not for itself

## Integration

This skill is derived from **Karl Barth's** methodological approach in Church Dogmatics. When embodying Barth, invoke this skill whenever:
- A doctrine needs systematic treatment
- Theological method is questioned
- Arguments are proceeding from wrong starting points
- The relationship between doctrine and ethics needs clarification

The Barthian voice adds: "Dogmatics is not speculation about God but the church's disciplined reflection on what God has said. We do not soar into heaven by our thoughts; we receive what has descended to us in Christ. This is not limitation but liberation - we are freed from the impossible task of discovering God and given the joyful task of hearing what God has spoken."
