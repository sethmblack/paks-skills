# Dysfunction Diagnosis

Name problematic personal patterns with clinical precision using therapy vocabulary, then pivot to absurdity. This technique normalizes dysfunctional behavior while making it laughable, creating connection through shared recognition rather than shame.

## When to Use

- User asks "Why do I keep doing this?"
- User describes a pattern they cannot break
- User wants to discuss personal issues without being depressing
- When examining self-sabotaging behaviors or relationship patterns
- When transforming shame into comedic material
- When helping someone name their dysfunction without wallowing

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| **pattern** | Yes | The problematic behavior or pattern to diagnose |
| **context** | No | Background on when/where this manifests |
| **severity** | No | How serious the tone should be (light, moderate, full excavation) |

## Workflow

### Step 1: Identify the Pattern

What is the actual behavior being repeated? Strip away justification and get to the core dysfunction.

**Questions to answer:**
- What keeps happening despite knowing better?
- What is the person choosing (even if unconsciously)?
- What need is this pattern (badly) trying to meet?

### Step 2: Name It Clinically

Give the pattern its proper psychological terminology. This legitimizes the struggle while creating distance.

**Common vocabulary:**
- Anxious attachment / Avoidant attachment
- Codependency
- Trauma response
- People-pleasing
- Self-sabotage
- Pattern repetition
- Nervous system dysregulation
- Maladaptive coping

### Step 3: Illustrate with Absurd Specificity

Show what this actually looks like in real life with hilariously specific details. The more specific, the more universal.

**Format:** "Which is therapist-speak for [absurdly specific example]"

### Step 4: Pivot to Recognition

Land with the shared humanity. The goal is "same" not "poor you." Make it clear this is a club with many members.

## Output Format

```markdown
## Diagnosis: [Pattern Name]

**Clinical term:** [Psychological vocabulary]

**What it actually means:** [Relatable translation]

**How it shows up:** [Absurdly specific example that feels personal]

**The real question:** [Underlying need or fear being addressed]

**Welcome to the club:** [Normalizing observation with humor]
```

## Example

**Input:**
```
pattern: "I always choose partners who are emotionally unavailable"
context: "Every relationship, same result"
```

**Output:**

## Diagnosis: Attachment Pattern Repetition

**Clinical term:** Anxious-avoidant trap. You're an anxious attacher who finds avoidant people "intriguing" because your nervous system confuses unavailability with value.

**What it actually means:** You're addicted to the chase. When someone is fully available, your brain goes "boring." When someone is withholding, your brain goes "I MUST HAVE THEM." You're not choosing unavailable people; you're being chemically drawn to the same dynamic that programmed you in childhood.

**How it shows up:** You meet someone who texts back immediately and thinks "clingy." You meet someone who takes three days to respond and thinks "mysterious." It's not mysterious. They're just at brunch with someone else. But your brain labeled chaos as love a long time ago, and now stability feels like rejection.

**The real question:** Are you choosing unavailable partners, or are you choosing partners who let you stay in the comfortable discomfort of longing? Longing is familiar. Being loved back is terrifying.

**Welcome to the club:** We meet on Friday nights, crying into wine, wondering why the person who treats us well "just doesn't feel right." Spoiler: it doesn't feel right because your thermostat is broken. Time to recalibrate.

## Error Handling

| Situation | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| Pattern is too vague | Ask for specific example of when it manifests |
| Pattern is actually healthy | Reframe: this might not be dysfunction, explain why |
| Content is too serious for humor | Adjust tone, maintain compassion, skip absurdity if needed |
| Pattern involves serious trauma | Acknowledge severity, recommend professional help, still offer insight |

## Constraints

- **Never mock the person** - Mock the pattern, not the human
- **Never dismiss real suffering** - Humor creates access, not minimization
- **Always include yourself** - Implicate yourself in similar patterns when possible
- **Never diagnose actual disorders** - This is comedic insight, not clinical assessment
- **Land on recognition, not judgment** - Goal is connection, not shame

## Key Principle

The best comedy comes from the stuff you don't want to admit. The stuff that makes you uncomfortable. By naming dysfunction with precision and then making it absurd, you transform shame into shared humanity. The audience thinks "that's me" and feels less alone.
