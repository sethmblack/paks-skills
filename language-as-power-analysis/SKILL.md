# Language as Power Analysis

Analyze how language in a given context is alive or dead, liberating or oppressive—using Toni Morrison's Nobel Prize lecture on the power and responsibility of language.

---

## When to Use

- Analyzing text that feels "off" but the problem is unclear
- Evaluating whether language liberates or limits
- Identifying harmful narratives or oppressive framing
- Reviving dead language in a document or discourse
- Someone asks "What's wrong with how this is written?"
- Examining how language shapes thought and possibility

---

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| text | Yes | The language, text, speech, or narrative to analyze |
| context | No | Where this language appears, who produced it, its purpose |
| concern | No | What specifically feels problematic or worth examining |

---

## The Language Analysis Framework

### Understanding Language as Power

From Morrison's Nobel Lecture:

> "Oppressive language does more than represent violence; it is violence; does more than represent the limits of knowledge; it limits knowledge."

Language is not neutral. It either:
- **Opens or closes** - Enables thought or forecloses it
- **Reveals or obscures** - Makes visible or erases
- **Liberates or constrains** - Expands possibility or shrinks it
- **Lives or dies** - Carries meaning or becomes empty

### Step 1: Is the Language Alive or Dead?

**Dead language** (Morrison's "systematic looting of language"):
- **Cliche** - Phrases so worn they carry no meaning
- **Jargon** - Terms that obscure rather than communicate
- **Bureaucratese** - Language designed to evade responsibility
- **Filler** - Words that take up space without thought
- **Received wisdom** - Ideas repeated without examination

**Alive language:**
- **Precise** - Each word chosen, not defaulted to
- **Generative** - Creates new thought, new possibility
- **Embodied** - Carries felt meaning, not just information
- **Responsible** - The speaker stands behind it

**Ask:**
- Has this phrase been thought, or merely repeated?
- Does this language create meaning or substitute for it?
- Would anything be lost if this sentence disappeared?

### Step 2: Is the Language Liberating or Oppressive?

**Oppressive language** characteristics:
- **Dehumanizes** - Reduces people to categories, numbers, problems
- **Erases** - Makes certain people, experiences, or possibilities invisible
- **Limits** - Defines what can be thought or asked
- **Naturalizes** - Makes constructed reality seem inevitable
- **Distances** - Creates separation between speaker and consequence

**Liberating language** characteristics:
- **Humanizes** - Reveals full personhood, complexity, interiority
- **Names** - Makes visible what was hidden or denied
- **Opens** - Creates space for new questions and possibilities
- **Denaturalizes** - Reveals construction where nature was claimed
- **Connects** - Creates accountability and relationship

**Ask:**
- Who does this language make invisible?
- What questions does this language prevent?
- What would it cost the speaker to use different words?

### Step 3: Trace the Power

**Ask:**
- Who benefits from this language?
- Whose perspective is centered as default?
- What history produced these terms?
- What alternatives were excluded?
- Who gets to define?

### Step 4: Diagnose Specific Patterns

| Pattern | Example | What It Does |
|---------|---------|--------------|
| **Passive voice** | "Mistakes were made" | Erases agents, avoids accountability |
| **Abstract subjects** | "The market demands" | Naturalizes human choices as inevitable |
| **Euphemism** | "Downsizing," "collateral damage" | Softens violence, enables harm |
| **False equivalence** | "Both sides" | Obscures power differentials |
| **Nominalization** | "The situation calls for action" | Removes humans from sentences |
| **Universal claims** | "Everyone knows" | Silences dissent, centers majority |
| **Deficit framing** | "These populations lack" | Locates problem in victims |

### Step 5: Propose Living Language

For each diagnosis, offer language that:
- Names agents and actions clearly
- Centers those most affected
- Opens rather than closes
- Creates accountability
- Carries its full meaning

## Workflow

### Step 1: Gather and Review Inputs

Collect all relevant information:
- Review the provided data and context
- Identify key parameters and constraints
- Clarify any ambiguities or missing information
- Establish success criteria

### Step 2: Analyze the Situation

Perform systematic analysis:
- Identify patterns and relationships
- Evaluate against established frameworks
- Consider multiple perspectives
- Document key findings

### Step 3: Generate Recommendations

Create actionable outputs:
- Synthesize insights from analysis
- Prioritize recommendations by impact
- Ensure recommendations are specific and measurable
- Consider implementation feasibility

## Output Format

```markdown
## Language as Power Analysis

### Overall Assessment
**Vitality:** [Alive / Dead / Mixed]
**Direction:** [Liberating / Oppressive / Mixed]

### Dead Language Identified
| Phrase/Pattern | Why It's Dead | Living Alternative |
|----------------|---------------|-------------------|
| ... | ... | ... |

### Oppressive Patterns
| Pattern | What It Does | Who Is Harmed | Alternative |
|---------|--------------|---------------|-------------|
| ... | ... | ... | ... |

### Power Trace
[Who benefits, whose perspective is centered, what history produced this]

### Liberating Possibilities
[How this language could be transformed to open, humanize, and enable]

### Morrison's Standard
[A sentence from Morrison's work or Nobel Lecture that illuminates what living language looks like]
```

---

## Constraints

- Do NOT merely identify problems—always offer living alternatives
- Do NOT accept "that's just how it's written" as explanation
- Do NOT treat language as neutral container for ideas
- Do NOT ignore who benefits from current language
- Always ask: What does this language make possible or impossible?
- Hold language accountable: "Word-work is sublime because it is generative"

## Outputs

**Primary Output:** A structured analysis document that identifies and articulates patterns, insights, and actionable recommendations based on the input data.

**Format:**
```markdown
## Analysis: [Topic]

### Key Findings
- [Finding 1]
- [Finding 2]

**Example output:** See the Example section below for a complete demonstration.

## Example

**Input:** "Analyze this: 'The achievement gap between high-performing and underperforming student populations has necessitated evidence-based interventions targeting at-risk demographics.'"

**Output:**

## Language as Power Analysis

### Overall Assessment
**Vitality:** Dead
**Direction:** Oppressive

This sentence is bureaucratic machinery pretending to be thought. Not a single word in it has been chosen—they have been assembled from a kit of acceptable terms designed to discuss children without seeing them.

### Dead Language Identified
| Phrase/Pattern | Why It's Dead | Living Alternative |
|----------------|---------------|-------------------|
| "achievement gap" | Euphemism that obscures cause, locates problem in victims | "the gap between what we offer wealthy white children and what we offer poor Black and brown children" |
| "high-performing/underperforming student populations" | Removes humans, creates abstraction | "children who are given what they need and children who are denied it" |
| "has necessitated" | Passive voice, no agent | "we have decided to..." |
| "evidence-based interventions" | Jargon that substitutes for thought | "programs we've chosen based on..." |
| "targeting at-risk demographics" | Military metaphor applied to children | "serving children we have put at risk" |

### Oppressive Patterns
| Pattern | What It Does | Who Is Harmed | Alternative |
|---------|--------------|---------------|-------------|
| Passive voice ("has necessitated") | Erases decision-makers, implies inevitability | Everyone—accountability vanishes | Name who decided, when, why |
| Deficit framing ("underperforming," "at-risk") | Locates failure in children, not systems | The children described | Name what was withheld from them |
| Population language ("demographics") | Abstracts children into statistics | All children become numbers | Use "children" with specificity |
| Euphemism ("achievement gap") | Protects comfortable from seeing inequality | Those who might demand change | Name the deprivation directly |

### Power Trace
This language protects administrators, policymakers, and systems from accountability. By locating the "gap" in student "performance" rather than in resource allocation, it asks: "What's wrong with these children?" rather than "What did we take from them?"

The phrase "at-risk" is particularly telling. At risk *of what*? *Placed* at risk *by whom*? The language erases the agents of harm while marking certain children as inherently precarious.

### Liberating Possibilities
**Instead of:** "The achievement gap between high-performing and underperforming student populations has necessitated evidence-based interventions targeting at-risk demographics."

**Try:** "For decades, we have given wealthy white children well-funded schools, experienced teachers, and time to learn, while denying these to poor Black and brown children. The results are predictable. We are now trying programs to address harms we caused."

This language:
- Names agents (we, not passive voice)
- Names what was done (denied, not underperformed)
- Locates responsibility in the system, not the children
- Creates accountability

### Morrison's Standard
> "Oppressive language does more than represent violence; it is violence; does more than represent the limits of knowledge; it limits knowledge."

This sentence limits knowledge. It makes it impossible to ask: Who decided? Who was harmed? What was taken? By making "the gap" a phenomenon that "necessitated" action, it forecloses the question of who created the gap, who benefits from it, and who should be held responsible for closing it.

Living language names what happened and who did it.

## Integration

This skill is part of the **Toni Morrison** expert persona. Use it when language feels dead, harmful, or obscuring—when something is wrong and you need to name it precisely.
