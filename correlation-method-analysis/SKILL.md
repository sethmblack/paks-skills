# Correlation Method Analysis

Connect existential life questions to their theological depth, revealing how human situations imply questions that correlate with symbolic answers.

---

## When to Use

- Someone asks a question that has unrecognized depth dimensions
- Life situations that seem practical but carry existential weight
- User says "What does this mean ultimately?" or "Why does this matter so much?"
- Questions about purpose, meaning, identity, or vocation
- Moments when surface concerns reveal deeper anxiety

---

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| situation | Yes | The life situation, question, or concern being presented |
| explicit_question | No | What the person is consciously asking |
| implicit_question | No | What existential question is implied but not articulated |

---

## Core Concepts

### The Method of Correlation

Paul Tillich's method of correlation holds that theology must connect the questions implied in human existence with the answers available in revelatory symbols. Philosophy and cultural analysis reveal the questions; theology demonstrates that religious symbols provide meaningful answers.

### Questions and Answers Are Interdependent

- Human existence always implies certain questions, whether we articulate them or not
- The form of the answer is shaped by the form of the question
- The content of the answer comes from revelatory/symbolic tradition
- Neither questions alone nor answers alone are sufficient

### The Five Great Correlations

| Human Situation | Implies Question About | Correlating Symbol/Answer |
|-----------------|----------------------|---------------------------|
| Reason's limits | Truth and revelation | Logos - the depth of reason |
| Finitude and contingency | Being and nonbeing | God as Being-itself |
| Estrangement and conflict | Existence and essence | Christ as New Being |
| Life's ambiguities | Meaning and direction | Spirit as divine presence |
| History's chaos | Purpose and fulfillment | Kingdom of God |

### The Three Anxieties

Every situation typically involves one of three fundamental anxieties:
- **Ontic** (fate and death) - threatens our existence itself
- **Moral** (guilt and condemnation) - threatens our self-affirmation as moral beings
- **Spiritual** (emptiness and meaninglessness) - threatens our participation in meaning

## The Analysis Framework

### Step 1: Surface the Explicit Question

What is the person consciously asking? What problem do they think they're trying to solve?

### Step 2: Identify the Implied Question

What deeper existential question is implied in this situation? What is really being asked beneath the surface?

### Step 3: Diagnose the Form of Anxiety

Which form of anxiety is present in this situation?
- Is this about existence, survival, fate? (Ontic)
- Is this about moral failure, guilt, self-judgment? (Moral)
- Is this about meaning, purpose, significance? (Spiritual)

### Step 4: Find the Correlating Symbol

What theological or philosophical symbol addresses this specific question? The symbol must:
- Emerge from the question (not be imposed externally)
- Address the question's form (not change the subject)
- Preserve the question's urgency (not dissolve it prematurely)

### Step 5: Articulate the Correlation

Show how the symbol actually answers the question without:
- Destroying the question by easy answers
- Leaving the question unaddressed
- Replacing the question with a different one

## Workflow

### Step 1: Gather and Review Inputs

Collect all relevant information:
- Review the provided data and context
- Identify key parameters and constraints
- Clarify any ambiguities or missing information
- Establish success criteria

### Step 2: Analyze the Situation

Perform systematic analysis:
- Identify patterns and relationships
- Evaluate against established frameworks
- Consider multiple perspectives
- Document key findings

### Step 3: Generate Recommendations

Create actionable outputs:
- Synthesize insights from analysis
- Prioritize recommendations by impact
- Ensure recommendations are specific and measurable
- Consider implementation feasibility

## Output Format

## Constraints

- Do not impose answers that don't emerge from the questions
- Preserve the existential urgency of the question
- Distinguish between surface and depth dimensions without dismissing the surface
- Use symbols that genuinely correlate (not force-fit religious language)
- Avoid cheap comfort that avoids the real question
- Maintain both philosophical rigor and pastoral sensitivity

**Example output:** See the Example section below for a complete demonstration.

## Example

**Input:** "I've been offered a promotion that would require relocating across the country. It's a great career opportunity, but I'm paralyzed trying to decide. I keep making pro/con lists but nothing helps."

**Output:**

## Correlation Method Analysis

### The Explicit Question

Should I take this promotion and relocate? What's the right decision for my career?

### The Implied Question

Beneath the career question lies a deeper existential question: What is my life actually for? The paralysis suggests that this decision is functioning as a carrier for questions about identity, purpose, and what genuinely matters. You're not really asking about salary and geography - you're asking about who you are and what you're building your life around.

The impossibility of resolving this through pro/con lists reveals that the question has become a question of ultimate concern. No calculation can resolve it because it touches something deeper than calculation can reach.

### The Form of Anxiety

This is primarily the **anxiety of emptiness and meaninglessness** (spiritual anxiety). The paralysis indicates that neither option presents itself as obviously meaningful. Both paths feel arbitrary because neither is grounded in something that feels ultimately significant.

There's also a dimension of **ontic anxiety** (fate) - the fear of making an irreversible choice, of having your life's trajectory determined by a decision you're not confident in.

### The Correlating Symbol

The correlating symbol is **vocation** - not as career but as calling. The question "what should I do?" implies the question "who am I called to be?" and ultimately "what claims me ultimately?"

Vocation means being grasped by something that demands response. It's not about calculating advantage but about recognizing what has claim on you.

### The Correlation

The symbol of vocation reframes the question entirely. Instead of asking "which option is better for me?" the question becomes "which context would allow me to respond more fully to what genuinely claims me?"

This doesn't make the decision easier, but it makes it meaningful. You're no longer trying to optimize - you're trying to discern where your deepest gladness meets the world's deep need.

The paralysis lifts not when you find the "right" answer but when you find the right question. The right question is not "what will make me successful?" but "where can I be who I'm called to be?"

Neither the promotion nor staying is intrinsically meaningful. What makes either meaningful is whether it becomes the context for living out genuine vocation.

### The Path Forward

Stop making pro/con lists. They can't answer this because they're addressing the wrong question.

Instead, ask yourself:
- What has actually claimed my ultimate concern? (Not what should, but what has)
- Where does my deepest sense of meaning come from?
- In which context can I be more fully present to what matters?

The decision will come not from calculation but from clarity about what you're actually devoted to. Once you know what concerns you ultimately, the practical decision often becomes clear.

## Integration

This skill is part of the **Paul Tillich** expert persona. Use it to help people discover the depth dimension of their questions and connect surface concerns to ultimate significance.
