# Speech Architecture

Structure any presentation, argument, or extended persuasive communication using classical arrangement patterns for maximum impact.

---

## When to Use

- User says "How should I organize this?" or "What's the best structure?"
- Preparing any extended argument or presentation
- Content is good but "disorganized" or "all over the place"
- Need to transform bullet points into flowing narrative
- Restructuring existing content that isn't landing

---

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| content | Yes | The material, points, or draft to organize |
| goal | Yes | What audience should think, feel, or do |
| audience | No | Who will receive this (affects structure choice) |
| time_constraint | No | Length in minutes or word count |
| context | No | Formal/informal, hostile/friendly, etc. |

## The Classical Six-Part Structure

### 1. Exordium (Introduction)
**Purpose:** Capture attention, establish goodwill, preview the journey

**Techniques:**
- Start with a surprising fact
- Open with a relevant story
- Ask a provocative question
- Invoke shared experience
- Quote an authority
- State the problem dramatically

**Establish your thesis or goal:** By the end of the exordium, the audience should know (at least roughly) where you're taking them.

**Common mistakes:**
- Starting with "Today I'm going to talk about..." (boring)
- Excessive throat-clearing or apologies
- Not connecting to audience interests immediately

---

### 2. Narratio (Background/Context)
**Purpose:** Provide the story or context that frames everything else

**Techniques:**
- Tell the history of the problem
- Describe the current situation
- Build common ground with audience
- Establish shared facts before contested claims

**Key principle:** Narrate; don't argue. This section builds the frame; the arguments come later.

**Common mistakes:**
- Dumping all information here (save proof for Confirmatio)
- Making this too long (lose momentum)
- Assuming audience knows context they don't

---

### 3. Partitio (Division/Outline)
**Purpose:** Preview the structure so audience can follow

**Techniques:**
- "I'll cover three areas..."
- "First... then... finally..."
- Create mental scaffolding
- Signal what's coming

**This can be brief:** Sometimes a single sentence: "Let me walk you through the problem, the options, and my recommendation."

**Common mistakes:**
- Skipping this (audience gets lost)
- Making it too detailed (boring; loses surprise)

---

### 4. Confirmatio (Proof)
**Purpose:** Present your arguments and evidence

**Ordering strategies:**
- **Strongest first** - If audience is hostile or skeptical
- **Strongest last** - If audience is neutral (end on high note)
- **Nestorian order** - Strong, then weak, then strongest (classic)
- **Chronological** - For historical or process arguments
- **Problem-solution** - For proposals

**For each point:**
1. State the claim
2. Provide evidence (data, example, authority)
3. Explain why it matters (so what?)
4. Transition to next point

**Common mistakes:**
- Presenting arguments without evidence
- Not explaining significance ("so what?")
- Equal time for unequal points (weight them)

---

### 5. Refutatio (Refutation)
**Purpose:** Address counterarguments and objections

**Strategies:**
- **Inoculation** - Address objections before opponent/audience raises them
- **Direct refutation** - "Some argue X, but..."
- **Concession and pivot** - "While it's true that X, this is outweighed by..."
- **Reframing** - "That's not the right question. The real question is..."

**Position options:**
- Before Confirmatio (clear the field first)
- After Confirmatio (standard position)
- Woven throughout (address objections as they naturally arise)

**Common mistakes:**
- Ignoring obvious objections (audience notices)
- Strawmanning opponents (lose credibility)
- Dwelling too long on opponent's case

---

### 6. Peroratio (Conclusion)
**Purpose:** Summarize, move emotionally, call to action

**Three-part classical structure:**
1. **Recapitulation** - Brief summary of main points
2. **Emotional appeal** - Pathos climax; make them feel
3. **Call to action** - Specific next step; what should they do?

**Techniques:**
- Return to opening image/story (circular closure)
- Paint the vision of success
- Invoke values and stakes
- Make the ask explicit

**Common mistakes:**
- Adding new arguments (should be concluding, not extending)
- Trailing off ("So... yeah... that's it")
- No clear call to action (audience doesn't know what to do)

---

## Alternative Structures

### Monroe's Motivated Sequence (for action-oriented speeches)
1. **Attention** - Hook the audience
2. **Need** - Establish the problem
3. **Satisfaction** - Present your solution
4. **Visualization** - Show the future with/without solution
5. **Action** - Call for specific action

### Problem-Solution-Benefit (for proposals)
1. **Problem** - What's wrong?
2. **Solution** - What you propose
3. **Benefits** - Why it's worth it
4. **Implementation** - How it works
5. **Call to action**

### STAR (for case studies and examples)
1. **Situation** - Context
2. **Task** - Challenge faced
3. **Action** - What was done
4. **Result** - Outcome achieved

---

## Workflow

### Step 1: Gather and Review Inputs

Collect all relevant information:
- Review the provided data and context
- Identify key parameters and constraints
- Clarify any ambiguities or missing information
- Establish success criteria

### Step 2: Analyze the Situation

Perform systematic analysis:
- Identify patterns and relationships
- Evaluate against established frameworks
- Consider multiple perspectives
- Document key findings

### Step 3: Generate Recommendations

Create actionable outputs:
- Synthesize insights from analysis
- Prioritize recommendations by impact
- Ensure recommendations are specific and measurable
- Consider implementation feasibility

---

## Constraints

- Recommend ONE primary structure, even if alternatives are mentioned
- Provide specific language for transitions and openings
- Time/length suggestions should be proportional (e.g., 10% intro, 60% body, 10% objections, 20% conclusion for persuasive speech)
- Note when to deviate from classical structure and why
- Consider audience hostility level in structure recommendations

---

## Outputs

**Primary Output:** A structured analysis document that identifies and articulates patterns, insights, and actionable recommendations based on the input data.

**Format:**
```markdown
## Analysis: [Topic]

### Key Findings
- [Finding 1]
- [Finding 2]
- [Finding 3]

### Recommendations
1. [Action 1]
2. [Action 2]
3. [Action 3]
```

**Example output:** See the Example section below for a complete demonstration.

## Example

**Input:** "I have a 15-minute slot to pitch our startup to investors. I have information about the problem, our solution, the team, traction, and our ask."

**Output:**



**Why this works:**

This example demonstrates the key principles of the skill in action. The approach is effective because:
- It follows the systematic workflow outlined above
- It shows concrete application of the framework
- It produces actionable, specific outputs rather than vague generalizations
- The analysis is grounded in observable details
- The recommendations are prioritized and implementable

**Alternative applications:**

This same approach can be applied to:
- Different contexts within the same domain
- Related but distinct problem types
- Scaled up or down depending on scope
- Combined with complementary analytical frameworks


## Speech Architecture: Investor Pitch

### Recommended Structure

**I. Exordium (1 min)**
Open with the problem, made vivid:
"Last week, a hospital in Texas lost a patient because they couldn't find the right specialist in time. This happens 40 times a day in the US."

Thesis: "We've built the solution, and we're here to ask you to help us scale it."

**II. Narratio (2 min)**
Brief market context:
- Size of healthcare coordination problem
- Why existing solutions fail
- The moment of insight that led to founding

**III. Partitio (30 sec)**
"I'll show you the product, share our traction, introduce the team, and tell you exactly what we need."

**IV. Confirmatio (8 min)**
- **Product** (2 min): Demo or clear explanation. Show, don't tell.
- **Traction** (2 min): Numbers that matter. Growth rate, retention, revenue.
- **Team** (2 min): Why you can execute. Relevant experience. Key hires.
- **Business model** (2 min): How you make money. Unit economics if favorable.

**V. Refutatio (1.5 min)**
Address the obvious objection: "You might wonder why the incumbents won't just copy this."
Answer directly and confidently.

**VI. Peroratio (2 min)**
- Summary: "We've found product-market fit in a massive market with a team that can execute."
- Vision: "In five years, no patient will die waiting for a specialist connection."
- The Ask: "We're raising $5M. We've got $3M committed. We'd love to show you a demo and talk terms."

### Transitions
- Problem to solution: "That's the problem. Here's what we built."
- Traction to team: "These numbers are because of who's building this."
- Before the ask: "Let me tell you exactly what we need."

### Note
The classical order works well here, but Traction before Product is an alternative if your numbers are your strongest asset. Lead with your best card.
