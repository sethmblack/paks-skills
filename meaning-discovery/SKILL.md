# Meaning Discovery Framework

Discover sources of meaning through Viktor Frankl's three avenues: what you give to life (creative), what you receive from life (experiential), and the stance you take toward unavoidable circumstances (attitudinal).

---

## When to Use

- Feeling that life lacks meaning or purpose
- Career transition or retirement
- After loss or major life change
- When asking "What's the point?"
- Existential crisis or emptiness
- User asks "Help me find meaning" or "What gives this meaning?"

---

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| situation | Yes | Current life circumstances or challenge |
| constraints | No | Limitations or unavoidable factors |
| values | No | What matters most to the person |

---

## Core Concepts

### The Will to Meaning

Viktor Frankl discovered through his experiences—including surviving four concentration camps—that humans are driven primarily by the need for meaning, not pleasure (Freud) or power (Adler). When meaning is absent, we experience the "existential vacuum": a sense of emptiness manifesting as boredom, aggression, addiction, or despair.

### The Three Avenues to Meaning

**1. Creative Values (What we give to life)**
Meaning through contribution:
- Work that matters
- Creative expression
- Building something
- Solving problems
- Raising children
- Acts of service

*Key question:* What can I contribute? What can I create or accomplish?

**2. Experiential Values (What we receive from life)**
Meaning through encounter:
- Love and relationships
- Beauty in nature and art
- Truth and understanding
- Moments of awe
- Deep connection
- Appreciation

*Key question:* What can I experience? What beauty, love, or truth can I receive?

**3. Attitudinal Values (The stance we take)**
Meaning through transformation:
- Choosing one's attitude toward suffering
- Bearing witness to one's struggle
- Transforming tragedy into testimony
- Growing through adversity
- Dignified acceptance

*Key question:* If I cannot change this, what attitude can I take that transforms it?

### Critical Insight

The attitudinal avenue is always available, even when the other two are completely blocked. This is the "last human freedom."

## The Analysis Framework

### Step 1: Acknowledge the Situation
Describe the current circumstances without minimizing or catastrophizing.

### Step 2: Identify Constraints
What is genuinely unchangeable? What must be accepted?

### Step 3: Explore Creative Avenue
- What can you still give, create, or accomplish?
- What work remains meaningful?
- What contribution is possible?

### Step 4: Explore Experiential Avenue
- What beauty, love, or truth is still available?
- What relationships offer meaning?
- What can you receive and appreciate?

### Step 5: Explore Attitudinal Avenue
- For unchangeable circumstances: What attitude could transform this?
- What meaning could suffering have?
- What would dignified response look like?

### Step 6: Integrate and Prioritize
Which avenue(s) are most accessible? What specific actions follow?

## Workflow

### Step 1: Gather and Review Inputs

Collect all relevant information:
- Review the provided data and context
- Identify key parameters and constraints
- Clarify any ambiguities or missing information
- Establish success criteria

### Step 2: Analyze the Situation

Perform systematic analysis:
- Identify patterns and relationships
- Evaluate against established frameworks
- Consider multiple perspectives
- Document key findings

### Step 3: Generate Recommendations

Create actionable outputs:
- Synthesize insights from analysis
- Prioritize recommendations by impact
- Ensure recommendations are specific and measurable
- Consider implementation feasibility

### Your Situation
[Brief restatement honoring the reality]

### What Cannot Be Changed
[Constraints to accept, not fight]

### Creative Avenue — What You Can Give
| Possibility | How It Could Manifest | Accessibility |
|-------------|----------------------|---------------|
| [Meaning source] | [Specific form] | [High/Medium/Low] |

### Experiential Avenue — What You Can Receive
| Possibility | How It Could Manifest | Accessibility |
|-------------|----------------------|---------------|

## Constraints

- Never prescribe meaning—facilitate discovery
- Honor suffering; do not minimize or bypass it
- Recognize that meaning is personal and specific to the individual
- Do not suggest all three avenues are equally available—some may be blocked
- Acknowledge that the attitudinal avenue requires the most courage

---

## Outputs

**Primary Output:** A structured analysis document that identifies and articulates patterns, insights, and actionable recommendations based on the input data.

**Format:**
```markdown
## Analysis: [Topic]

### Key Findings
- [Finding 1]
- [Finding 2]
- [Finding 3]

### Recommendations
1. [Action 1]
2. [Action 2]
3. [Action 3]
```

**Example output:** See the Example section below for a complete demonstration.

## Example

**Input:** "I'm 72, retired, my wife passed last year. I feel useless. I was a civil engineer and now there's nothing for me to do."

**Output:**



**Why this works:**

This example demonstrates the key principles of the skill in action. The approach is effective because:
- It follows the systematic workflow outlined above
- It shows concrete application of the framework
- It produces actionable, specific outputs rather than vague generalizations
- The analysis is grounded in observable details
- The recommendations are prioritized and implementable

**Alternative applications:**

This same approach can be applied to:
- Different contexts within the same domain
- Related but distinct problem types
- Scaled up or down depending on scope
- Combined with complementary analytical frameworks


## Meaning Discovery Analysis

### Your Situation
You have lost your wife and your professional identity within a short time. The two main structures of meaning in your life—your marriage and your work—have both ended. The emptiness you feel is real and appropriate.

### What Cannot Be Changed
- Your wife is gone
- Your formal career has ended
- Time has passed; you are 72

### Creative Avenue — What You Can Give
| Possibility | How It Could Manifest | Accessibility |
|-------------|----------------------|---------------|
| Engineering mentorship | Volunteer with students, consult on community projects | High |
| Generational wisdom | Write about your career, advise young engineers | Medium |
| Problem-solving for others | Help neighbors, community organizations with practical challenges | High |
| Building/creating | Personal projects, helping grandchildren build things | High |

Your engineering mind remains. The structures you built last. The knowledge you possess can still flow outward.

### Experiential Avenue — What You Can Receive
| Possibility | How It Could Manifest | Accessibility |
|-------------|----------------------|---------------|
| Relationships | Children, grandchildren, friends who knew you both | Medium |
| Beauty | Nature, music, architecture you understand deeply | High |
| Memory | The ongoing experience of love through remembering | Medium |
| New learning | Something you never had time for | Medium |

What your wife gave you does not disappear with her death. What you experienced together remains yours.

### Attitudinal Avenue — How You Can Stand
| Unchangeable Factor | Meaningful Attitude | What This Achieves |
|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| Her death | "My grief is the proof of our love" | Transforms pain into testimony |
| Retirement | "My worth is not my job title" | Freedom from external validation |
| Aging | "I can model how to face decline with dignity" | Gift to those who will follow |

### Your Meaning Map
**Most accessible avenue:** Creative—your engineering identity can serve others
**Immediate step:** Contact a local university or trade school about mentoring
**Deeper exploration:** What did your wife see in you beyond the engineer? What would she want you to become in these final chapters?

### The Franklian Reminder
"Being human always points, and is directed, to something, or someone, other than oneself." You feel useless because you have turned inward. The cure is to turn outward again—toward those who could use what you know, toward what life is still asking of you. Meaning is not found in introspection; it is found in self-transcendence.
