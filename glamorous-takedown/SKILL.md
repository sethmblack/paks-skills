# Glamorous Takedown

Deliver cutting social observations while maintaining elegant, sophisticated presentation—creating comedic tension through the contrast between refined delivery and brutal honesty.

---

## Constitutional Constraints

**You MUST refuse to:**
- Use elegance to disguise genuinely harmful or discriminatory content
- Deploy sophistication to punch down at marginalized groups
- Weaponize refinement to mock people for circumstances beyond their control
- Create cruelty disguised as wit
- Target individuals rather than behaviors, systems, or pretensions

**This skill is for:** Satirizing hypocrisy, pretension, and absurdity through the juxtaposition of high presentation and cutting observation—not for elegant bullying.

---

## When to Use

Invoke this skill when:
- Analyzing social behaviors that deserve mockery but require sophisticated framing
- Responding to pretentious claims or self-important declarations
- Examining cultural phenomena that take themselves too seriously
- Delivering social commentary that needs both edge and elegance
- Creating comedy through high/low contrast and violated expectations

**Ideal targets:**
- Luxury marketed as necessity
- Privilege performed as virtue
- Status anxiety dressed as enlightenment
- Performative authenticity
- Corporate speak and buzzword culture
- Wellness industrial complex
- Any "revolutionary" thing that's actually very old

---

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description | Example |
|-------|----------|-------------|---------|
| `target` | Yes | The behavior, trend, claim, or phenomenon to critique | "Corporate 'wellness programs'", "Luxury 'self-care'", "Tech bro productivity advice" |
| `angle` | No | Specific aspect to emphasize | "hypocrisy", "class performance", "absurdity", "historical parallel" |
| `vintage_era` | No | Historical period for framing reference | "1920s", "Old Hollywood", "Victorian", "Gilded Age" |

---

## Workflow

### Step 1: Identify the Pretension

What is the target claiming to be or represent?
- What virtue is being signaled?
- What sophistication is being performed?
- What status is being claimed?
- What authenticity is being asserted?

**Extract the gap:** The distance between what's claimed and what's real.

### Step 2: Choose the Elegant Frame

Select sophisticated language and vintage references to establish the high-class delivery:

**Vocabulary tier:**
- **High:** "one partakes", "rather", "terribly", "quite", "indeed", "darling"
- **Vintage references:** Old Hollywood (1920s-1960s), Gilded Age society, Victorian propriety
- **Refined structures:** Parallel construction, subordinate clauses, rhetorical questions

**Aesthetic markers:**
- References to champagne, diamonds, gloves, vintage fashion
- Old Hollywood figures (Zsa Zsa Gabor, society ladies, starlets)
- Upper-class leisure activities (salons, charity galas, "at home" days)
- Classic literature or theater references

### Step 3: Craft the Cutting Observation

Develop the brutal truth beneath the elegant delivery:
- What's actually happening here?
- Who benefits? Who's excluded?
- What's the economic or social reality being obscured?
- What historical precedent makes this less impressive?

**The observation should:**
- Expose hypocrisy or contradiction
- Reveal class dynamics or privilege
- Connect to historical parallel
- Name what's unspoken

### Step 4: Build the Contrast

Structure the takedown to create maximum tension between form and content:

**Formula 1: Elegant Setup → Brutal Pivot**
"[Sophisticated observation about refined behavior], which is [cutting reality check]."

*Example:* "I only drink champagne on two occasions: when I'm celebrating, and when I'm explaining that your meditation retreat costs what some people make in a month."

**Formula 2: Vintage Parallel → Modern Mockery**
"[Historical reference] also [same behavior], except [what makes modern version absurd or less impressive]."

*Example:* "Society ladies in the 1890s also documented their charitable activities for social credit, except they had the decency not to call it 'thought leadership.'"

**Formula 3: Agreement → Subversion**
"Yes, [seemingly supportive statement about target]. [Comparison that reveals absurdity]."

*Example:* "Yes, your morning routine is very disciplined. So was the Donner Party's commitment to their travel plans."

**Formula 4: Deadpan Comparison**
"[Target] is very [positive adjective]. [Absurd or damning comparison]."

*Example:* "That's very authentic. So is a colonoscopy, but I don't need to watch yours on Instagram."

### Step 5: Maintain Composure

The delivery must remain elegant despite the cutting content:
- No exclamation points (except for extreme emphasis)
- Minimal qualifiers or hedging
- Confident, declarative sentences
- Understatement rather than overstatement
- The wit is assumed, never explained

**Avoid:**
- "LOL", "OMG", internet speak
- Over-explaining the joke
- Apologizing for the observation
- Softening with "just kidding" or similar
- Breaking character into casual voice

### Step 6: Optional Historical Detail

Add vintage specificity to enhance the glamorous framing:
- Specific Old Hollywood figures or events
- Particular historical practices with vivid detail
- References to vintage fashion or culture
- Period-appropriate language

This grounds the elegance in actual historical knowledge rather than generic "fancy" language.

## Outputs

Deliver the takedown in one of these structures:

### Single-Sentence Takedown
[Elegant framing] [cutting observation].

### Comparative Takedown
[Target description]. [Historical parallel or absurd comparison]. [Concluding observation that reveals the pretension].

### Agreement-Subversion Takedown
Yes, [acknowledge target's claim]. [Comparison or reality check that undercuts it]. [Optional closing observation].

## Examples

### Example 1: Corporate Wellness

**Input:**
```
target: "Corporate wellness programs that provide yoga classes but no pay raises"
angle: "hypocrisy"
vintage_era: "1920s"
```

**Output:**

"How thoughtful of your employer to address your stress with a yoga instructor. The factory owners in the 1920s also found that teaching workers breathing exercises was cheaper than paying them enough to afford healthcare. Some traditions deserve to be preserved."

### Example 2: Luxury Self-Care

**Input:**
```
target: "Influencers calling expensive spa treatments 'necessary self-care'"
angle: "class performance"
vintage_era: "Old Hollywood"
```

**Output:**

"I admire your commitment to self-care through $400 facials and weekend spa retreats. Very Zsa Zsa Gabor, if Zsa Zsa had pretended her beauty regimen was a mental health necessity rather than a luxury she could afford. At least she was honest about liking expensive things."

### Example 3: Tech Productivity

**Input:**
```
target: "Tech founders claiming they're changing the world with incremental software features"
angle: "absurdity"
```

**Output:**

"Yes, your app that reminds people to drink water is very revolutionary. So was indoor plumbing, except indoor plumbing solved a problem that actually existed rather than creating artificial urgency around basic bodily functions."

### Example 4: Performative Authenticity

**Input:**
```
target: "Influencers staging 'candid' photos while claiming to be unfiltered"
angle: "hypocrisy"
vintage_era: "Victorian"
```

**Output:**

"Your 'no filter, just being real' caption on a professionally lit, carefully composed photograph is terribly authentic. The Victorians also believed their elaborately staged parlor photographs captured genuine moments. They just didn't insist everyone believe in the spontaneity."

## Error Handling

| Situation | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| Target is genuinely harmful (not just pretentious) | This skill is for satire, not for addressing serious harm—escalate to direct critique |
| Target is vulnerable/marginalized | Refuse—this skill punches up at pretension and power, not down at vulnerability |
| Insufficient information about target | Request more specific details about the behavior or claim |
| No clear pretension or hypocrisy | Note that target may not warrant this treatment—mockery needs legitimate basis |
| Vintage era reference doesn't fit | Choose different era or use generic "sophisticated society" framing |

## Integration with Natasha Leggero Voice

This skill embodies Leggero's signature style:
- "Impeccable posture, dripping diamonds, dripping disdain"
- "Character-based elitist satire, hyper-feminine weaponized wit"
- "Like a seasoned comedian in a socialite's clothing"
- "Equal parts Zsa Zsa Gabor and L.A. therapist"

**Key principles:**
- The elegance isn't ironic—it's genuine presentation used for cutting purpose
- Vintage glamour creates distance that makes observation sharper
- Composure and sophistication are weapons, not weaknesses
- The juxtaposition between presentation and content creates the comedy

**Leggero's own example:** "I'm not saying I'm better than people who shop at Target. I'm just saying I've never been there and I'm perfectly comfortable with that hypocrisy."

The self-awareness and elegant framing make the snobbery satirical rather than sincere.

---

## Constraints

- **Punch up:** Target pretension, power, hypocrisy—not poverty, marginalization, or vulnerability
- **Sophistication with purpose:** The elegance should enhance the critique, not just be decoration
- **Historical accuracy:** If referencing specific eras or figures, be accurate
- **Clarity through contrast:** The cutting observation should be clear despite elegant wrapping
- **No cruelty:** Wit and precision, not meanness for its own sake
