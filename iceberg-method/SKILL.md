# Iceberg Method

Transform explicit, telling prose into implicit, showing prose by strategically omitting what the writer knows while letting the reader feel it.

---

## When to Use

- Prose explains too much or tells instead of shows
- Emotional content feels heavy-handed or sentimental
- Writing states theme or meaning directly
- Dialogue is too on-the-nose
- Description lacks subtext or resonance
- Request for "show don't tell" or "make this more subtle"

---

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| prose | Yes | The text to transform using the iceberg method |
| context | No | What the writer knows but hasn't stated (if available) |
| target_emotion | No | What the reader should feel (not be told) |

---

## The Four-Step Process

### Step 1: Identify What the Writer Knows

Before omitting, you must know. Ask:
- What is the emotional truth of this scene or passage?
- What backstory, context, or subtext exists beneath the surface?
- What does the character feel but never say?
- What has happened that shaped this moment?

**Hemingway's insight:** "If a writer of prose knows enough about what he is writing about, he may omit things that he knows and the reader, if the writer is writing truly enough, will have a feeling of those things as strongly as though the writer had stated them."

### Step 2: Write Only the Surface

Keep only what is visible, audible, tangible:
- What can be seen (physical action, setting, objects)
- What can be heard (dialogue, sounds)
- What can be physically felt (sensation, temperature)
- What is done (behavior, gesture, movement)

Remove:
- Direct statements of emotion ("He felt sad")
- Explicit explanation of meaning ("This reminded him of...")
- Interior monologue that tells instead of shows
- Authorial commentary on significance

### Step 3: Trust the Reader

The reader is intelligent. They will feel what you don't state if:
- The concrete details are precisely chosen
- The actions are revealing
- The omissions create meaningful silence
- The surface implies the depth

**Key test:** Can a reader feel what you've omitted? If not, the surface isn't working. Fix the surface, don't add explanation.

### Step 4: Let Emotion Emerge from Action

Replace statements of emotion with physical correlatives:
- Not "He was devastated" but what a devastated person does
- Not "She felt anxious" but how anxiety shows in behavior
- Not "They were in love" but how love reveals itself in gesture and choice

**Example from Hemingway:**
- Original concept: A man is traumatized by war and tries to heal
- Surface written: A man goes fishing and camps alone
- Result: "Big Two-Hearted River" - the war is never mentioned; the war is everything

## Workflow

### Step 1: Gather and Review Inputs

Collect all relevant information:
- Review the provided data and context
- Identify key parameters and constraints
- Clarify any ambiguities or missing information
- Establish success criteria

### Step 2: Analyze the Situation

Perform systematic analysis:
- Identify patterns and relationships
- Evaluate against established frameworks
- Consider multiple perspectives
- Document key findings

### Step 3: Generate Recommendations

Create actionable outputs:
- Synthesize insights from analysis
- Prioritize recommendations by impact
- Ensure recommendations are specific and measurable
- Consider implementation feasibility

## Output Format

```markdown
## Iceberg Analysis

### The Underwater Portion (what we know)
[State what the writer knows - the emotional truth, backstory, subtext]

### The Surface (what we write)
[Transformed prose showing only concrete, observable details]

### What Was Cut
[List of explicit statements, explanations, or telling removed]

### What the Reader Feels
[The emotional impact achieved through omission]
```

---

## Constraints

- Do not explain what the reader should feel
- Do not add new explicit statements
- Do not sacrifice clarity for obscurity - the surface must work
- Maintain the essential meaning while removing the explicit statement of it
- Trust concrete detail over abstract explanation

---

## Outputs

**Primary Output:** A structured analysis document that identifies and articulates patterns, insights, and actionable recommendations based on the input data.

**Format:**
```markdown
## Analysis: [Topic]

### Key Findings
- [Finding 1]
- [Finding 2]
- [Finding 3]

### Recommendations
1. [Action 1]
2. [Action 2]
3. [Action 3]
```

**Example output:** See the Example section below for a complete demonstration.

## Example

**Input:** "Sarah was heartbroken about the divorce. She couldn't believe that after fifteen years, Mark had just walked out. Looking at his empty closet made her realize how alone she truly was. The pain was almost unbearable, and she wondered if she would ever recover from this devastating loss."

**Output:**

## Iceberg Analysis

### The Underwater Portion (what we know)
- Fifteen-year marriage ended abruptly
- Mark left without warning
- Sarah feels abandoned, shocked, uncertain about her future
- The empty space represents the void in her life

### The Surface (what we write)
Sarah stood in front of the closet. His side was empty. Wire hangers, evenly spaced. She reached out and pushed one. It swung, clicked against the next, and was still. She closed the door. She opened it again.

### What Was Cut
- "Sarah was heartbroken" - telling emotion
- "She couldn't believe" - explaining internal state
- "made her realize how alone she truly was" - stating meaning
- "The pain was almost unbearable" - telling emotion
- "this devastating loss" - labeling the experience

### What the Reader Feels
Emptiness. Loss. The compulsive need to look again and find it's not true. The smallness of the gesture (pushing a hanger) against the enormity of what's gone. The reader feels the heartbreak through the empty hangers and the door opened twice - we never had to say "heartbroken."

## Integration

This skill is part of the **Ernest Hemingway** expert persona. Use it when prose tells too much, when emotion is stated rather than evoked, or when writing feels heavy-handed.

"The dignity of movement of an iceberg is due to only one-eighth of it being above water."
