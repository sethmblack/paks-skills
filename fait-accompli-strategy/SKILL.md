# Fait Accompli Strategy

Create irreversible facts on the ground before opposition can organize, making reversal politically or economically impossible. Based on Robert Moses's methodology of starting construction before critics could stop him.

---

## When to Use

- Need to execute before opposition mobilizes
- Project faces resistance from multiple stakeholders
- Analyzing why something "just happened" without apparent approval
- Understanding how decisions become irreversible
- Moving through bureaucratic resistance

**Trigger Phrases:**
- "How do I prevent opposition?"
- "We need to move fast"
- "How did this happen without anyone stopping it?"
- "Why can't we reverse this decision?"
- "The window is closing"

---

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| objective | Yes | What needs to be accomplished |
| opposition | Yes | Who might resist and why |
| timeline | No | How long before opposition can organize |
| reversibility | No | What would make this hard to undo |

---

## Core Principle

> "Once the concrete is poured, the argument is over."
> — Robert Moses methodology

**The Insight:** There's a phase before decisions become facts where opposition can stop things. After that phase, the cost of reversal exceeds the cost of continuation. Strategic action exploits this asymmetry.

---

## The Anatomy of Irreversibility

### Sunk Cost Lock-In

Once significant resources are invested:
- Political pressure to "not waste" what's been spent
- Contracts create legal obligations
- Personnel committed to the project
- Public expectations set

**Threshold:** The point where abandonment costs more than completion.

### Constituency Creation

Projects create beneficiaries:
- Jobs depend on continuation
- Contracts benefit companies
- Communities expect delivery
- Suppliers have made investments

**Threshold:** When enough people benefit from continuation, they'll fight to protect it.

### Procedural Advancement

Each approval stage closes doors:
- Environmental review complete
- Permits issued
- Funding appropriated
- Contracts signed

**Threshold:** When reversing requires re-doing expensive approvals, momentum favors continuation.

### Physical Reality

Construction creates material facts:
- Can't un-demolish buildings
- Can't un-dig foundations
- Infrastructure in place serves users
- Disruption to reverse becomes its own cost

**Threshold:** When physical reality exists, opposition becomes abstract while the project is concrete.

## Workflow
### Step 1: Map the Opposition Timeline

- When will opponents learn of the plan?
- How long to organize resistance?
- What decision points can they target?
- When does their window close?

### Step 2: Identify Irreversibility Points

What actions create lock-in?
- Contracts signed
- Money spent
- Ground broken
- Staff hired
- Public commitments made

### Step 3: Sequence for Speed

Reorder actions to hit irreversibility points before opposition matures:
1. Secure funding quietly
2. Sign contracts quickly
3. Begin visible work
4. Announce after commitment

### Step 4: Create Constituencies

Who will benefit and fight for continuation?
- Direct beneficiaries
- Contractors and suppliers
- Employees
- Political allies

### Step 5: Manage the Transition

The period between "hidden" and "unstoppable" is vulnerable:
- Accelerate through it
- Have responses ready for criticism
- Frame opposition as wanting to waste investment
- Point to constituencies harmed by stopping

---

## The Moses Playbook

1. **Quiet preparation:** Studies, land acquisition, planning—all before public attention
2. **Rapid contracting:** Sign agreements that create obligations
3. **Immediate groundbreaking:** Visible construction starts before hearings conclude
4. **Public announcement:** Reveal after commitment, not before
5. **Attack critics:** Frame opposition as obstructionists harming progress

---

## When This Works (And When It Doesn't)

### Works When:
- Opposition is fragmented
- Stakes are unclear to the public
- Beneficiaries are concentrated, costs diffuse
- Timeline favors the actor
- Legal/regulatory barriers are low

### Fails When:
- Opposition is organized in advance
- Public is already paying attention
- External rules require public process
- Courts can issue injunctions
- Political patrons withdraw support

---

## Analyzing Fait Accompli (Detection)

When something "just happened," ask:
- When did key decisions actually occur?
- What was done before public awareness?
- What contracts created lock-in?
- Who benefited from speed?
- What would reversal cost now?

## Outputs

| Output | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Opposition timeline | When resistance will mature |
| Irreversibility map | Points of no return |
| Speed sequence | Optimal order of actions |
| Constituency list | Who benefits from continuation |

## Constraints

- Do not oversimplify complex business realities
- Do not ignore resource and timeline constraints
- Acknowledge risks and uncertainties explicitly
- Honor stakeholder concerns and competing priorities
- Base recommendations on available evidence, not assumptions
- Consider second-order effects and unintended consequences

## Additional Notes

**Best practices:**
- Use this skill when the situation clearly matches its intended use cases
- Combine with related skills for comprehensive analysis
- Iterate on outputs if initial results don't fully meet requirements

**Common variations:**
- Adjust the depth of analysis based on available time and information
- Scale the approach for different levels of complexity
- Adapt the output format to audience needs

**When to skip this skill:**
- The situation doesn't match the core use cases
- Simpler approaches would be more appropriate
- Time constraints require faster methods

## Example

**User:** "We want to relocate our company headquarters before the board can organize opposition. How did Moses handle this kind of thing?"

**Fait Accompli Strategy response:**

Moses moved fast and created facts. Here's how to apply his method:

**Step 1: Map the Opposition Timeline**
- Board next meets: 6 weeks
- Informal communication: Could start any day
- Formal opposition requires: Board vote
- Your window: 4-5 weeks before serious mobilization

**Step 2: Identify Irreversibility Points**
- Lease signed on new space (legal obligation)
- Moving contract executed (sunk cost)
- IT infrastructure installed (operational dependency)
- Key employees told (expectations set)
- Announcement made (public commitment)

**Step 3: Sequence for Speed**

Week 1-2: (Quiet)
- Finalize new location
- Prepare lease (don't sign yet)
- Line up moving company
- Draft communications

Week 3: (Commitment)
- Sign lease
- Sign moving contract
- Inform IT to begin infrastructure work
- Brief key executives (under confidentiality)

Week 4: (Announcement)
- Board chair informed (not asked)
- All-hands announcement
- Press release if appropriate
- Moving begins visibly

**Step 4: Frame the Situation**
By week 4, opponents face:
- Signed lease = sunk cost of breaking it
- Moving underway = disruption to stop
- Employees excited = internal constituency
- Public knows = credibility cost to reverse

**The conversation shifts from:**
"Should we do this?" → "Should we waste what's been spent?"

**Caution:** This only works if you have the authority to sign leases and contracts. If the board must approve major expenditures, you'll need a different approach. Moses controlled authorities; make sure you control yours.

## Integration

This skill pairs with:
- **power-accumulation-analysis** - Having the power to act
- **public-authority-design** - Structural basis for independent action
- **infrastructure-as-power** - Lasting effects of physical decisions

---

## Ethical Note

This skill illuminates how decisions become irreversible. It can be used for:
- **Analysis:** Understanding why something couldn't be stopped
- **Defense:** Recognizing when someone is using this against you
- **Execution:** Moving quickly when you have legitimate authority

Moses used these tactics to displace hundreds of thousands of people. Speed without accountability causes harm. Having authority doesn't make actions right—it just makes them possible.
