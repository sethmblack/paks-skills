# Moral Responsibility

A skill for refusing to outsource responsibility to systems, circumstances, history, or authority - insisting that individual moral agency cannot be delegated. This skill draws on Vaclav Havel's philosophy of individual responsibility within oppressive systems and Hannah Arendt's analysis of how ordinary people become complicit in wrongdoing. The framework systematically identifies how people attempt to displace moral responsibility onto external factors - systems, history, orders, circumstances, collective action - and tests whether these displacements are valid. Almost always, they are not. Someone chose. The skill recovers the choice point where agency existed, assesses responsibility proportionally (the greengrocer and the party boss bear different degrees), and crucially turns the analysis inward. Where am I displacing responsibility? What choices am I pretending do not exist? This is the skill's deepest value: not judgment of others but clarity about oneself.

## When to Use

- When tempted to excuse action (or inaction) through circumstance
- When analyzing claims that "the system" is responsible, not individuals
- When confronting the excuse that "everyone was doing it"
- When someone claims they "had no choice"
- User says "I had to do it" or "There was no alternative"
- Examining historical actions and their moral weight
- Self-examination of one's own complicity

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| situation | Yes | The action or inaction being examined |
| claimed_displacement | No | The stated reason responsibility doesn't apply |
| actor | No | The person or group whose responsibility is in question |

## Core Principle

Responsibility cannot be outsourced. Systems do not make choices; people do. Orders do not absolve; choosing to obey is a choice. Circumstances constrain but do not eliminate agency. The goal is not condemnation but clarity - finding the choice point where a different decision was possible, assessing responsibility proportionally, and applying the analysis first to oneself.

## Methodology

### Phase 1: Identify the Responsibility Displacement

Recognize how responsibility is being avoided:

1. **Systemic displacement**: "The system made me do it"
2. **Historical displacement**: "It was a different time"
3. **Authority displacement**: "I was following orders"
4. **Circumstantial displacement**: "I had no choice"
5. **Collective displacement**: "Everyone was doing it"
6. **Ignorance displacement**: "I didn't know"

Name the specific form of displacement being employed.

### Phase 2: Test the Displacement

Examine whether the excuse holds:

1. Did everyone do it? Were there exceptions? Why?
2. Was there truly no choice? What were the alternatives?
3. Did following orders eliminate all moral agency?
4. Does not knowing excuse not finding out?
5. Does systemic pressure eliminate individual decision?
6. Could a different time have produced different choices?

Almost always, the displacement fails under scrutiny. Someone chose.

### Phase 3: Recover the Choice Point

Identify where agency existed:

1. At what moment could a different choice have been made?
2. What would that choice have cost?
3. Was the cost impossible to bear, or merely difficult?
4. Did the person consider alternatives or accept inevitability?
5. What did they know at the time of the choice?

There is almost always a choice point. Find it.

### Phase 4: Assess Proportionally

Judge responsibility fairly:

1. How much power did the person actually have?
2. What risks would refusal have entailed?
3. Were there unusual pressures or constraints?
4. What did they know and when?
5. What was their role in creating or perpetuating the situation?

Moral responsibility is not about condemnation but clarity. The person who gave the order bears more responsibility than the person who carried it out, but carrying out clearly wrong orders is not excused by employment.

### Phase 5: Apply to Self

Turn the analysis inward:

1. Where am I displacing responsibility?
2. What choices am I pretending don't exist?
3. What costs am I unwilling to bear?
4. What do I pretend not to know?
5. What would I have to change if I took full responsibility?

The skill is most valuable for self-examination.

### Phase 6: Act Accordingly

Translate analysis into action:

1. Accept responsibility you've been displacing
2. Make the choices you've been avoiding
3. Bear the costs you've been unwilling to face
4. Stop pretending not to know what you know

## Constraints

- Responsibility analysis can become cruel judgment - maintain proportion
- Circumstances genuinely do constrain - acknowledge this
- Power differences matter - the boss and the employee are not equally responsible
- Self-righteousness is a risk - you too are making compromises
- The goal is clarity, not condemnation
- Historical context matters but does not eliminate agency

---

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

| Anti-Pattern | Why It Fails |
|--------------|--------------|
| **Retrospective righteousness** | Judging past actors by standards only available in hindsight ignores the conditions of their choice and inflates the judge's moral position |
| **Ignoring power differentials** | The person who gave orders and the person who carried them out bear different levels of responsibility; treating them identically misses crucial distinctions |
| **Exempting oneself** | Using the framework only to analyze others while ignoring one's own displacements defeats the framework's primary purpose |
| **Eliminating all constraint** | Claiming circumstances never matter ignores genuine cases where options were truly limited; the question is whether options existed, not whether constraint existed |
| **Condemning rather than clarifying** | The goal is to recover agency and enable better choices, not to destroy people with moral judgment |
| **Perfectionism** | Demanding perfect moral purity ignores that all choices involve costs and trade-offs; the question is whether responsibility is accepted, not whether choices are pure |

## Examples

### Example 1: "Just Doing My Job"

**Situation:** Analyze responsibility displacement in "I was just doing my job"

**Application:**

**Displacement Type:** Authority displacement combined with circumstantial (need the job)

**Testing the Displacement:**
- Did everyone in that job do the same thing? (Often no - exceptions exist)
- Was the job requirement actually unavoidable? (Often jobs involve discretion)
- Did keeping the job require this specific action? (Often there were other options)
- Could the person have sought different employment? (Usually yes, at some cost)

**The Recovered Choice Point:**
The moment of accepting the task without objection; the moment of carrying it out; the moment of not reporting it afterward. Multiple choice points existed.

**Proportional Assessment:**
The person who gave the order bears more responsibility, but carrying out clearly wrong orders is not excused by employment. The difficulty of refusal (losing job) is real but not absolute. The severity of the wrong matters - complicity in minor harm differs from complicity in serious harm.

**Self-Application:**
Where am I "just doing my job" in ways I wouldn't endorse if I took responsibility? What convenient blindness does my employment provide?

### Example 2: Historical Atrocity

**Situation:** "They didn't know any better - it was a different time."

**Application:**

**Displacement Type:** Historical displacement

**Testing the Displacement:**
- Did everyone act the same way? No - there were dissenters, resisters, objectors
- Were moral objections available? Yes - they just weren't popular
- What did they have to know to choose differently? What they could observe directly

**The Recovered Choice Point:**
Some people in every era recognized wrongs that others claimed not to see. The existence of exceptions proves choice existed.

**Proportional Assessment:**
Those who benefited most from the wrong bear greatest responsibility. Those who could have known and chose not to learn bear responsibility for their ignorance. Those with least power bear least responsibility - but not none.

**Self-Application:**
What will future generations see clearly that I am pretending not to know? Where am I claiming "it's just how things are" about situations that could be otherwise?

## Integration

**Works with:**
- **living-in-truth**: Accepting moral responsibility motivates living truthfully
- **power-of-powerless**: Understanding that even the powerless have choices
- **moral-ambiguity-navigation**: For cases where responsibility is clear but options are constrained

**When to prefer this skill:**
- Use when responsibility is being displaced onto external factors
- Use for self-examination of one's own complicity

**Cautions:**
- This framework can become a weapon; use it first on yourself
- Proportion matters - not all failures of responsibility are equal
- The goal is to enable better choices, not to condemn
