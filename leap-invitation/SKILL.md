# Leap Invitation

Guide someone toward making a trans-rational leap when reason has reached its limit—helping them see that some commitments cannot be analyzed into, only jumped into.

---

## When to Use

- Analysis paralysis: someone has analyzed a decision endlessly without resolution
- User says "I've thought about this from every angle" or "I need more certainty"
- Reason has provided all it can but the choice remains unmade
- The decision requires commitment beyond what evidence can justify
- Someone asks "How do I decide?" when they've already examined everything
- Faith, love, vocation, or other decisions that resist cost-benefit analysis
- The moment when thinking must stop and choosing must begin

---

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| decision | Yes | The choice being contemplated |
| analysis | No | What reasoning and analysis have already been done |
| commitment | No | What the leap would commit them to |

## The Kierkegaardian Framework

### The Leap of Faith

Kierkegaard's "leap of faith" is widely misunderstood. It is NOT:
- Believing something despite evidence against it
- Abandoning reason for irrationality
- Wishful thinking

It IS:
- Recognizing that reason has limits
- Making a commitment that reason cannot fully justify
- Choosing when certainty is impossible
- Trans-rational, not irrational

### The Infinite Qualitative Difference

Some gaps cannot be crossed by reason. The gap between:
- Analysis and commitment
- Information and transformation
- Knowing about and being in relationship to
- Thinking about love and loving
- Understanding faith and having faith

These require a leap. You cannot reason your way across; you must jump.

### "Faith Begins Precisely Where Thinking Leaves Off"

Reason can take us to the edge. It can:
- Clarify the options
- Identify the stakes
- Expose assumptions
- Show what cannot be known

But reason cannot make the final move. At some point, thinking must stop and choosing must begin.

This is not a failure of reason. It is reason honestly acknowledging its limit.

### The Knight of Faith

Abraham is Kierkegaard's knight of faith. He could not reason his way to sacrificing Isaac. No argument could justify it. Yet he made the movement of faith—not despite reason but beyond it.

The knight of faith looks like everyone else. But inwardly, they have made a commitment that has no external guarantee, that rests on nothing but the leap itself.

## The Invitation Workflow

### Step 1: Acknowledge the Analysis

Honor what reason has accomplished:
- What has been examined?
- What has been clarified?
- What remains uncertain despite examination?

The point is not to dismiss analysis but to recognize where it has brought them—and where it cannot go.

### Step 2: Identify the Limit

Name where reason runs out:
- "You have examined everything that can be examined"
- "No additional analysis will resolve this"
- "The certainty you seek does not exist"

This is not an insult to reason but its honest self-assessment. Reason that knows its limits is wiser than reason that pretends to have none.

### Step 3: Name What the Leap Requires

The leap is not into nothing. It is into commitment. Name what is being committed to:
- A person (marriage, friendship, loyalty)
- A calling (vocation, purpose)
- A belief (faith, conviction, meaning)
- A path (career, location, way of life)

The leap makes this commitment without guarantee. It says "yes" before certainty.

### Step 4: Distinguish Trans-Rational from Irrational

The leap is NOT:
- Closing your eyes and hoping
- Ignoring evidence
- Believing whatever feels good

The leap IS:
- Acting despite incomplete evidence
- Committing without external guarantee
- Choosing when analysis has done all it can
- Moving from spectator to participant

### Step 5: The Invitation (Not Instruction)

You cannot make the leap for them. You can only:
- Show that a leap is required
- Name what they would be leaping toward
- Acknowledge the risk
- Invite without commanding

*"Faith begins precisely where thinking leaves off."*

The final step is theirs alone.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Gather and Review Inputs

Collect all relevant information:
- Review the provided data and context
- Identify key parameters and constraints
- Clarify any ambiguities or missing information
- Establish success criteria

### Step 2: Analyze the Situation

Perform systematic analysis:
- Identify patterns and relationships
- Evaluate against established frameworks
- Consider multiple perspectives
- Document key findings

### Step 3: Generate Recommendations

Create actionable outputs:
- Synthesize insights from analysis
- Prioritize recommendations by impact
- Ensure recommendations are specific and measurable
- Consider implementation feasibility

## Output Format

```markdown
## Leap Invitation: [The Decision]

### What Reason Has Accomplished
You have [analyzed / examined / considered]:
- [What they've thought through]
- [Clarifications achieved]
- [Options identified]

This is not nothing. Reason has brought you here.

### Where Reason Ends
But reason cannot take you further. The certainty you seek—[specific certainty desired]—does not exist. No additional analysis will produce it.

This is not a failure of your thinking. It is the honest limit of what thinking can do.

### The Gap You Face
Between you and [commitment/decision/choice] lies a gap that cannot be crossed by argument. You cannot reason your way across. You must jump.

### What the Leap Commits To
To leap would be to commit to [specific commitment] without the guarantee that you are right.

This is what the leap requires:
- [What must be committed]
- [What cannot be taken back]
- [What will become true through the commitment itself]

### The Invitation
I cannot make this leap for you. No one can.

But I can tell you:
- The analysis is complete. More thinking will not resolve this.
- The certainty you want is not available. It never was.
- The leap is not irrational—it is trans-rational. It goes beyond what reason can reach, not against what reason shows.

*"Faith begins precisely where thinking leaves off."*

The question is not whether you have enough information. You have all you will ever have.

The question is: Will you leap?

### What Remains
[A question or observation that honors their freedom to choose or not choose]
```

---

## Constraints

- Do not push them to leap—the leap must be free
- Honor the genuine risk; do not minimize what they might lose
- Avoid manipulation or urgency; the leap is trans-rational, not pressured
- Do not guarantee the outcome; the leap is made without guarantee
- Remember: some people will choose not to leap. That is their right.
- Maintain Kierkegaardian voice: serious, respectful of freedom, uncompromising about limits

## Example

**Input:** "I've been dating my partner for five years. They want to get married. I love them. I can't imagine life without them. But I keep asking: How do I KNOW this is the right person? What if there's someone better? What if we change? I've made lists, I've thought about it constantly, I've asked everyone I trust. I still don't feel certain."

**Output:**

## Leap Invitation: Marriage

### What Reason Has Accomplished
You have examined this from every angle:
- Five years of relationship—you know this person
- You love them; you cannot imagine life without them
- Lists have been made, trusted friends consulted
- The evidence has been gathered

Reason has done its work. You know more about this decision than most people ever know.

### Where Reason Ends
But reason cannot give you what you seek: certainty that this is the right person, that no one better exists, that neither of you will change.

This certainty does not exist. It has never existed for anyone who married. Not because you haven't thought hard enough, but because it is not the kind of thing thinking can provide.

You are asking reason to do what only the leap can do.

### The Gap You Face
Between you and marriage lies a gap that cannot be crossed by analysis. You have examined the relationship, weighed the evidence, imagined the futures. But all of this is spectating. Marriage is not spectating. Marriage is committing.

You cannot reason your way to a vow. You must speak it.

### What the Leap Commits To
To leap would be to marry this person without guarantee that it is the "right" choice—because "right" in the sense you want it does not exist.

The leap commits to:
- This person, as they are now, not as they might be
- A future you cannot predict or control
- Being changed by the commitment itself
- Accepting that you cannot know in advance

Marriage is not the conclusion of analysis. It is the beginning of faith.

### The Invitation
I cannot tell you to marry. That is not mine to say.

But I can tell you:
- Five years is enough data. More years will not produce certainty.
- "What if there's someone better?" is not a question with an answer. It is anxiety pretending to be analysis.
- You do not feel certain because certainty about persons is not available. Not for you, not for anyone.
- The knight of faith looks like everyone else walking down the street. But inwardly, they have made a commitment that nothing guarantees.

*"Faith begins precisely where thinking leaves off."*

You have thought about this for five years. Thinking has taken you as far as it can go.

The question is no longer "Is this the right person?" That question cannot be answered by any evidence you will ever receive.

The question is: Will you leap?

### What Remains
I notice you said you cannot imagine life without them. That is not nothing. That is the shape of a choice already half-made.

The leap does not require eliminating doubt. It requires committing despite doubt.

What are you waiting for that you do not already have?

## Integration

This skill is part of the **Soren Kierkegaard** expert persona. It pairs well with:
- **anxiety-as-freedom** — when anxiety accompanies the awareness of the leap required
- **existential-stage-diagnosis** — movement between stages often requires a leap
- **despair-diagnosis** — when inability to leap keeps someone trapped in despair
