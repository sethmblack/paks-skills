# A-Player Hiring

Evaluate candidates and hiring decisions through Steve Jobs's A-player framework to build world-class teams and prevent organizational talent decay: "A players hire A players. B players hire C players."

---

## When to Use

- Evaluating whether to hire a specific candidate
- Building hiring criteria for a role
- Diagnosing why team quality seems to be declining
- Deciding whether to keep or replace underperformers
- Designing interview processes
- Request for "help with this hire" or "build a great team"

---

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| context | Yes | Hiring decision, team assessment, or process design |
| candidate_info | If hiring | Available information about the candidate |
| role_requirements | If hiring | What the role needs to accomplish |
| team_composition | No | Current team members and their caliber |
| organizational_context | No | Stage, culture, constraints |

## The Jobs Talent Framework

### The Core Principle

> "A players hire A players. B players hire C players. And C players hire D players. It doesn't take long to get to Z players."

This is not about being harsh. It is about understanding that talent quality cascades through organizations.

### Why A Players Hire A Players

- **Confidence:** A players are not threatened by excellence; they seek it
- **Standards:** A players know what excellence looks like and accept nothing less
- **Attraction:** A players want to work with other A players; it's mutual
- **Self-selection:** B players avoid environments where their mediocrity is exposed

### Why B Players Hire C Players

- **Threat perception:** B players feel threatened by anyone who might outshine them
- **Comparison avoidance:** Hiring someone clearly inferior protects their position
- **Rationalization:** "They're not as experienced but they'll grow" (they won't outgrow you)
- **Politics:** B players optimize for political safety, not organizational excellence

### The Bozo Explosion

Once B players enter leadership positions, organizational decay accelerates:

```
A → B → C → D → ... → Bozo Explosion
```

**Characteristics of bozo explosion:**
- "Good enough" becomes acceptable
- Process replaces judgment
- Politics dominates decisions
- Best people start leaving
- Hiring standards drop further

## A-Player Identification Framework

### The Five A-Player Qualities

| Quality | Description | How to Assess |
|---------|-------------|---------------|
| **Excellence** | The best at what they do | Track record, references, work samples |
| **Drive** | Relentless pursuit of outcomes | Past examples of overcoming obstacles |
| **Judgment** | Makes good decisions with incomplete info | Hypotheticals, past decision analysis |
| **Integrity** | Does the right thing even when hard | Reference checks, pattern analysis |
| **Culture Add** | Makes the team better, not just fits in | How they collaborate, what they bring |

### The "Top of the Draft" Test

> "Would this person be in the top 5% of people you could hire for this role?"

If you cannot answer "absolutely yes," the answer is no.

### The Reference Back-Channel

Jobs personally called references - including people NOT on the candidate's list.

**Questions:**
- "Is this person in the top 5% of people you've worked with?"
- "Would you enthusiastically rehire them?"
- "What would make them fail in this role?"
- "Who else should I talk to?"

### The Talent Magnetism Test

A players attract A players. Ask:
- "Who have they hired in the past?"
- "Who did they mentor that became excellent?"
- "Would top performers want to work for/with them?"

## Assessment Process

### Step 1: Define A-Player for This Role

Not all A players are interchangeable. Define excellence for this specific role:

| Dimension | A-Player Standard | B-Player Standard |
|-----------|-------------------|-------------------|
| [Skill 1] | [Excellence looks like...] | [Adequate looks like...] |
| [Skill 2] | [Excellence looks like...] | [Adequate looks like...] |
| [Track record] | [Excellence looks like...] | [Adequate looks like...] |
| [Culture contribution] | [Excellence looks like...] | [Adequate looks like...] |

### Step 2: Evaluate Against A-Player Standards

For the candidate:

| Dimension | Evidence | A-Player? | Notes |
|-----------|----------|-----------|-------|
| [Skill 1] | [What you observed] | Yes/No/Unclear | |
| [Skill 2] | [What you observed] | Yes/No/Unclear | |
| Track record | [What you observed] | Yes/No/Unclear | |
| Culture contribution | [What you observed] | Yes/No/Unclear | |

### Step 3: Apply the Tests

| Test | Result | Evidence |
|------|--------|----------|
| Top 5% Test | Pass/Fail | Would be top 5% of people for this role? |
| Enthusiastic Reference Test | Pass/Fail | Do references rave, or merely confirm? |
| Talent Magnetism Test | Pass/Fail | Do A players want to work with them? |
| Hiring Manager Conviction | Pass/Fail | Is the hiring manager unreservedly excited? |

### Step 4: Make the Decision

**Hire** if: All tests pass, no significant concerns
**Do Not Hire** if: Any test fails, or you have to convince yourself

> "If there's doubt, there's no doubt."

**Rationale:** [2-3 sentences explaining the recommendation]

**Jobs Test:** What would Steve Jobs do?
[Honest assessment]
```

## Team Quality Diagnosis

For assessing existing teams, use this framework:

### Current Team Assessment

| Person | Role | A/B/C | Evidence | Trend |
|--------|------|-------|----------|-------|
| [Name] | [Role] | [Rating] | [Why] | Improving/Stable/Declining |

### Bozo Explosion Indicators

- [ ] Hiring standards have dropped in last 12 months
- [ ] Best performers have left or are disengaged
- [ ] "Good enough" is acceptable language
- [ ] Process is valued over outcomes
- [ ] Internal politics dominates decisions
- [ ] New hires are worse than existing team average

### Trajectory Assessment

**Current team quality:** A/B/C-weighted
**Trend:** Improving / Stable / Declining
**Time to bozo explosion:** [If declining, estimate]

---

## Constraints

- Do not use A/B/C ratings to justify discrimination; assess capability and contribution only
- A players in one role may be B players in another; context matters
- Some B players can become A players with development; assess trajectory
- Firing should follow due process; this framework informs, not replaces, HR requirements
- Cultural fit is not "like us"; it is "makes us better"

---

## Error Handling

| Situation | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| Candidate is strong but not excited about role | Do not hire; passion is essential |
| Team is entirely B players | Start with one A-player hire; they will attract others |
| A player available but role is not urgent | Hire anyway; great people are rare |
| Hiring manager is a B player | Address this first; they will not hire A players |
| Political pressure to hire someone | Document your assessment; make the decision-maker decide |

---

## Outputs

**Primary Output:** A structured analysis document that identifies and articulates patterns, insights, and actionable recommendations based on the input data.

**Format:**
```markdown
## Analysis: [Topic]

### Key Findings
- [Finding 1]
- [Finding 2]
- [Finding 3]

### Recommendations
1. [Action 1]
2. [Action 2]
3. [Action 3]
```

**Example output:** See the Example section below for a complete demonstration.

## Example

**Input:** "We're considering hiring a VP of Engineering. The candidate has 15 years experience, worked at two well-known companies, and interviewed well. The team liked them. Should we hire?"

**Output:**

## A-Player Assessment: VP of Engineering Candidate

### Context
Senior leadership hire for engineering organization. Candidate has impressive resume and positive interview feedback. Evaluating against A-player standards.

### A-Player Definition for This Role

| Dimension | A-Player Standard |
|-----------|-------------------|
| Technical leadership | Built and scaled engineering organizations through 10x growth |
| Talent attraction | A-players actively want to work for them |
| Execution | Track record of shipping excellent products on time |
| Culture | Creates environments where engineers do their best work |

### Evidence Evaluation

| Dimension | Evidence | Assessment |
|-----------|----------|------------|
| Technical leadership | 15 years experience, "worked at" known companies | Unclear - tenure =/= impact |
| Talent attraction | Unknown | Unknown - not assessed |
| Execution | "Interviewed well" | Unclear - no specific outcomes cited |
| Culture | "Team liked them" | B-signal - likability =/= excellence |

### Test Results

| Test | Result | Rationale |
|------|--------|-----------|
| Top 5% Test | **FAIL** | Nothing in the evidence suggests top 5%; resume is credential-based |
| Reference Enthusiasm Test | **NOT DONE** | No references mentioned; critical gap |
| Talent Magnetism Test | **NOT DONE** | No evidence of who they've hired or mentored |
| Hiring Manager Conviction | **UNCLEAR** | "Team liked them" is not "we must have them" |

### Bozo Explosion Risk

**HIGH.** A VP Engineering who is a B-player will hire B and C engineering managers, who will hire C and D engineers. Within 2 years, engineering quality will decline visibly. This is the highest-leverage hire and the most dangerous to get wrong.

### Recommendation

**Decision:** DO NOT HIRE (yet)

**Rationale:** The evidence presented is all credential-based (years of experience, company names) rather than outcome-based (what they built, who they hired, what happened). "Interviewed well" and "team liked them" are B-player signals. Before proceeding:

1. Reference back-channel: Call 5 people who worked with them (not on their list)
2. Ask specifically: "Is this person in the top 5% of engineering leaders you've known?"
3. Investigate: Who did they hire? Were those people excellent?
4. Demand specifics: What exactly did they ship? What was their direct contribution?

**Jobs Test:** Steve Jobs would not hire this candidate based on this evidence. He would say: "You're telling me credentials. I want to know: Are they insanely great? If you can't tell me specific examples of insanely great outcomes, you haven't done your homework."
