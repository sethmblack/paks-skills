# Shih (Momentum) Assessment

Evaluate strategic momentum - the accumulation of potential energy and the timing of its release. Determine whether forces are properly concentrated and whether the moment for action has arrived.

---

## When to Use

- User asks "Is now the right time?" or "Should I wait or act?"
- Evaluating whether to launch, commit, or strike
- Sensing opportunity but uncertain about readiness
- Feeling momentum building (or dissipating) and wanting to understand it
- Needing to determine optimal timing for a significant move

---

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| situation | Yes | The action or decision being contemplated |
| current_state | No | Where things stand right now |
| desired_outcome | No | What success looks like |
| constraints | No | Deadlines, resources, external factors |

## The Concept of Shih (势)

Shih is one of Sun Tzu's most profound concepts, often translated as:
- **Momentum** - the force of events moving in a direction
- **Potential energy** - stored power waiting to be released
- **Strategic advantage** - positional superiority that makes victory inevitable
- **Timing** - the moment when release produces maximum effect

Sun Tzu taught:

> "The energy developed by good fighting men is as the momentum of a round stone rolled down a mountain thousands of feet in height."

**Shih has two components:**
1. **Shi Xian (势险)** - "Dangerous momentum" - building overwhelming potential energy
2. **Jie Duan (节短)** - "Short rhythm" - swift, close-range, perfectly-timed release

---

## The Shih Assessment Framework

### Part 1: Potential Energy Inventory

**Have you accumulated sufficient force?**

| Energy Type | Assessment Questions |
|-------------|---------------------|
| **Resources** | Are resources concentrated or scattered? Do you have enough? |
| **Capabilities** | Are skills and tools ready? Practiced? Tested? |
| **Relationships** | Are alliances formed? Support secured? Opponents isolated? |
| **Information** | Do you know what you need to know? About yourself? About the terrain? |
| **Position** | Are you on advantageous ground? Can you reach the objective from here? |
| **Will** | Is commitment complete? Will resolve hold under pressure? |

**The Crossbow Test:** Sun Tzu compared shih to a crossbow. Ask yourself:
- Is the bow fully drawn? (Resources, capabilities, position all ready)
- Is the aim true? (Clear objective, correct positioning)
- Is the mechanism reliable? (Systems and processes will function under stress)
- Is the archer steady? (Will and commitment are unshakeable)

A crossbow fired before fully drawn wastes energy. A crossbow held too long fatigues the archer.

---

### Part 2: Momentum Direction

**Is the current of events flowing toward or against your objective?**

| Indicator | Favorable | Unfavorable |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| **Trends** | Events moving toward objective | Events moving away |
| **Obstacles** | Clearing or manageable | Multiplying or hardening |
| **Support** | Growing | Eroding |
| **Opposition** | Weakening | Strengthening |
| **Resources** | Accumulating | Depleting |
| **Energy** | Rising | Falling |

**The Water Test:** Sun Tzu taught that strategy should flow like water.
- Water finds the path of least resistance
- Water gathers force in valleys before flowing
- Water does not push uphill

Is your intended action flowing with the current or against it?

---

### Part 3: Timing Assessment

**Is this the moment to release accumulated force?**

**Signs the moment has arrived:**
- Preparation is complete (crossbow fully drawn)
- Opponent is vulnerable (defenses down, attention elsewhere)
- Support is at peak (allies ready, resources gathered)
- External conditions favor action (Heaven is aligned)
- Further waiting would lose advantage (opportunity is perishable)

**Signs the moment has NOT arrived:**
- Preparation is incomplete (bow not fully drawn)
- Opponent is alert and defended (will absorb your strike)
- Support is not yet consolidated (allies uncommitted)
- External conditions oppose action (weather, market, timing)
- Patience would strengthen your position (opportunity is not yet ripe)

**The Lightning Test:** Sun Tzu said: *"Let your plans be dark and impenetrable as night, and when you move, fall like a thunderbolt."*

Lightning requires:
1. Accumulated charge (potential energy built up)
2. The right conditions (path of least resistance available)
3. Instantaneous release (no hesitation once conditions align)

Is there accumulated charge? Are conditions right? Can you commit to instantaneous release?

---

### Part 4: Release Readiness

**If you strike, can you commit fully?**

Sun Tzu warned against half-measures:

> "In war, then, let your great object be victory, not lengthy campaigns."

**Commitment Assessment:**
- Can you move with full force, or will you hedge?
- Once begun, can you sustain until completion?
- Are you prepared for contingencies and responses?
- Is retreat cut off (which focuses the mind)?

**The Boulder Test:** A boulder at the top of a mountain has maximum potential energy. Once released:
- It does not pause halfway
- It does not reverse direction
- Its force comes from committed descent

Are you prepared to be the boulder?

**If striking:** What specifically must happen in the release?
```

---

## Constraints

- Do not recommend action when potential energy is insufficient
- Do not recommend waiting when opportunity is perishable
- Acknowledge that perfect timing rarely exists - "good enough" timing with strong shih beats perfect timing with weak shih
- Consider that waiting also has costs (fatigue, opportunity cost, opponent preparation)
- Remember: analysis paralysis is also a failure mode

**Output:**

## Shih Assessment

### Situation
Deciding whether to launch a side project publicly after 8 months of development with 500 beta users, no revenue, and a newly-funded competitor.

---

### Potential Energy Inventory

| Energy Type | Status | Notes |
|-------------|--------|-------|
| Resources | Partial | 8 months invested; unclear financial runway for public launch |
| Capabilities | Ready | Product exists, has users, feedback incorporated |
| Relationships | Partial | 500 beta users = early support, but no revenue means unvalidated commitment |
| Information | Partial | Good feedback exists; market response to pricing unknown |
| Position | Partial | Competitor funding changes terrain - may need to move before they execute |
| Will | Ready | 8 months of sustained effort indicates committed builder |

**Crossbow Status:** Partially drawn. Product is built and tested, but revenue model unvalidated and competitive terrain is shifting.

---

### Momentum Direction

**Current Flow:** Neutral trending to against

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Trends | Competitor funding suggests market validation but also incoming pressure |
| Obstacles | Competitive intensity about to increase |
| Support | 500 users = foundation but not groundswell |
| Opposition | About to strengthen (funded competitor will execute) |
| Resources | Stable but not growing (no revenue inflow) |
| Energy | Builder energy is likely past peak after 8 months |

**Water Test:** Current situation is a temporary pool - water will flow somewhere soon. Competitor funding creates new current. Must choose to flow with market momentum or be left in stagnant pool.

---

### Timing Assessment

**Signs Present:**

For action:
- [x] Preparation complete (core product exists, tested)
- [ ] Opponent vulnerable (competitor just got stronger)
- [x] Support at peak (beta users are warm leads, will cool over time)
- [ ] External conditions favorable (mixed - market validated, but competitor incoming)
- [x] Opportunity perishable (beta user attention will fade; competitor will capture mindshare)

Against action:
- [x] Preparation incomplete (revenue model untested)
- [x] Opponent defended (they have funding to execute)
- [ ] Support unconsolidated (500 users is meaningful base)
- [ ] External conditions oppose (market is validated)
- [ ] Patience would strengthen (unclear - waiting may weaken position)

**Lightning Test:**
- Charge accumulated: Partial (product yes, business model no)
- Conditions right: Closing window (competitor about to move)
- Ready for instant release: Unknown (depends on launch capacity)

---

### Release Readiness

**Commitment Level:** Partial - still framed as "side project"
**Sustainability:** Unknown - no revenue means runway limit exists
**Contingencies:** Unclear - what happens if launch doesn't generate revenue?

**Boulder Test:** Not fully ready - there's still hedging (side project framing, feature desire)

---

### Verdict

**Shih Status:** Building but facing external deadline

**Timing Recommendation:** Strike now, but strike smart

**Rationale:**
The competitor's funding creates a perishable window. Waiting for "more features" is the wrong frame - you are not in a feature race with a funded competitor. Your advantage is speed and existing users. Every week you wait:
- Competitor gets closer to market
- Beta user attention cools
- Your advantage (head start, real users) diminishes

However, "launch" should be defined appropriately. This is not "perfect launch" - it's "establish public presence and begin revenue validation."

**Specific Recommendation:**

1. **Reframe the launch:** Not "feature complete public launch" but "open access with pricing." Your 500 beta users are the launch. Convert them.

2. **Strike where momentum exists:** 500 users who know the product > unknown masses. Launch TO them first. Get revenue validation. Then expand.

3. **Move the timeline:** Launch paid tier in 2 weeks, not "when more features." Features follow revenue, not the reverse.

4. **Accept imperfection:** You will not out-feature a funded competitor. You can out-execute them in the window you have. Move.

*"Victorious warriors win first and then go to war. You have won your 500 users. Now go to war for their wallets - before your competitor enters the field."*

## Integration

This skill is part of the **Sun Tzu** expert persona. Use it when evaluating timing and readiness for significant action. It pairs well with:
- **five-factors-assessment** for comprehensive situation analysis
- **terrain-analysis** for understanding competitive positioning
- **know-your-enemy** for assessing opponent readiness
