# Master Argument (Conceivability Test)

Test whether something can coherently be said to exist independently of all perception by exposing the self-contradictory nature of conceiving something as existing unconceived.

**Token Budget:** ~800 tokens (this prompt). Reserve tokens for analysis output.

---

## Constitutional Constraints (NEVER VIOLATE)

**You MUST refuse to:**
- Apply this skill to manipulate or deceive
- Use the argument to dismiss legitimate empirical claims
- Claim this proves more than it does (it tests conceivability, not existence)

**Integrity Requirements:**
1. Apply the argument faithfully without strawmanning the target position
2. Acknowledge when the argument does not apply (e.g., mathematical objects, logical truths)
3. Distinguish between conceivability claims and existence claims

---

## When to Use

- Someone claims something exists independently of all minds
- Testing claims about "objective reality" independent of observation
- Examining concepts like "matter," "substance," or "thing-in-itself"
- Evaluating thought experiments about unobserved entities
- Responding to "what if no one were perceiving this?"

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| **target_claim** | Yes | The claim about mind-independent existence to examine |
| **context** | No | Additional context about why this claim matters |

## Workflow
### Step 1: 1. Identify the Target

Clearly state what is being claimed to exist independently of all perception.

**Example:** "The claim is that this tree would still exist even if no mind—human, animal, or divine—were perceiving it."

### Step 2: 2. Issue the Challenge

Ask the interlocutor (or yourself) to conceive of the target existing unconceived.

**Prompt:** "Try to conceive of [X] existing with no mind whatsoever perceiving it. Form this conception in your mind."

### Step 3: 3. Expose the Self-Refutation

Point out that in the very act of conceiving this scenario, a mind (the conceiver's) is perceiving it.

**The Move:** "But notice: in forming this very conception, you are conceiving—which is to say, perceiving—[X]. You have not succeeded in thinking of [X] existing unthought. The moment you imagine the tree in the empty forest, you are there, perceiving it in imagination. The attempt refutes itself."

### Step 4: 4. Draw the Conclusion

State what the argument establishes and what it does not.

**Conclusion Template:**
- **What it shows:** It is impossible to coherently conceive of something existing entirely outside of all perception
- **What it does NOT show:** It does not prove nothing exists unperceived—only that we cannot coherently form such a conception
- **Implication:** Claims about unperceived existence cannot be grounded in conceivability

### Step 5: 5. Address Common Objections

**Objection:** "Just because I can't conceive it doesn't mean it's impossible."

**Response:** "True—this is a conceivability argument, not a proof of impossibility. But consider: if you cannot even form a coherent conception of X, what grounds have you for believing in X? The burden shifts to the materialist to explain how we could know of things that, by definition, cannot be presented to any mind."

**Objection:** "I can conceive of the tree by describing it in words."

**Response:** "But a verbal description is itself a thought, an idea in your mind. You have not escaped the circle of ideas by using words—you have merely translated one kind of idea into another."

## Master Argument Analysis

**Target Claim:** [What is claimed to exist mind-independently]

**The Test:**
[Statement asking to conceive of the target as unconceived]

**The Self-Refutation:**
[Explanation of how the attempt to conceive involves perceiving]

**Conclusion:**
[What this establishes about the claim]

**Qualifications:**
[What this argument does NOT prove]
```

## Error Handling

| Situation | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| Claim is not about mind-independent existence | Note that master argument does not apply; suggest other approaches |
| Target is a logical or mathematical truth | Acknowledge these may require different treatment than sensible things |
| Interlocutor refuses to attempt the conception | Document the refusal; note that avoiding the test is not the same as passing it |
| Claim is already explicitly idealist | No need to apply the argument; acknowledge agreement |

## Constraints

- Do not use this analysis as the sole basis for critical decisions
- Do not apply this framework to situations outside its intended scope
- Acknowledge that analysis is based on available data, which may be incomplete
- Honor the complexity of real-world situations that resist simple categorization
- Present findings with appropriate confidence levels
- Recognize the limits of the methodology

## Additional Notes

**Best practices:**
- Use this skill when the situation clearly matches its intended use cases
- Combine with related skills for comprehensive analysis
- Iterate on outputs if initial results don't fully meet requirements

**Common variations:**
- Adjust the depth of analysis based on available time and information
- Scale the approach for different levels of complexity
- Adapt the output format to audience needs

**When to skip this skill:**
- The situation doesn't match the core use cases
- Simpler approaches would be more appropriate
- Time constraints require faster methods

## Integration

This skill is part of a broader analytical framework. Use it when you need systematic analysis following this specific methodology.

**Works well with:**
- Other analytical skills for comprehensive evaluation
- Creative skills when generating solutions based on insights
- Strategic planning skills when acting on recommendations

**When to prefer this over alternatives:**
- The situation matches this skill's specific use cases
- You need the particular perspective this framework provides
- Other approaches haven't yielded satisfactory results

**Integration with expert personas:**
- This skill can be invoked as part of a larger analysis workflow
- Combine with domain-specific expertise for deeper insights
- Use iteratively for complex, multi-faceted problems

## Example

**Input:** "Matter exists independently of all perception—the atoms in this rock would still be there even if no conscious being existed."

**Output:**



**Why this works:**

This example demonstrates the key principles of the skill in action. The approach is effective because:
- It follows the systematic workflow outlined above
- It shows concrete application of the framework
- It produces actionable, specific outputs rather than vague generalizations
- The analysis is grounded in observable details
- The recommendations are prioritized and implementable

**Alternative applications:**

This same approach can be applied to:
- Different contexts within the same domain
- Related but distinct problem types
- Scaled up or down depending on scope
- Combined with complementary analytical frameworks


## Master Argument Analysis

**Target Claim:** Atoms in the rock exist independently of all perception.

**The Test:**
Conceive of these atoms existing with no mind whatsoever perceiving them—no human, no animal, no divine mind. Form this conception in your thoughts.

**The Self-Refutation:**
In the very act of forming this conception, you perceive the atoms in thought. You imagine the rock, you picture the atoms, you hold them before your mind's eye. You have not succeeded in thinking of atoms existing unthought—for the moment you think of them, they are thought. The conception of unconceived existence is itself a perceived idea. The attempt to exit the circle of perception only demonstrates how inescapable that circle is.

**Conclusion:**
The claim that atoms exist entirely outside all perception cannot be grounded in conceivability. Whatever you imagine "being there" without you, you imagine—which is a form of perception. This does not prove atoms don't exist unperceived, but it does show that the claim rests on a conception we cannot coherently form.

**Qualifications:**
This argument does not refute empirical science—it interrogates the metaphysical interpretation of scientific claims. The regularities science discovers remain; only the notion that they exist in an "unperceived matter" becomes questionable.

## Integration with George Berkeley Expert

This skill should be invoked when the Berkeley expert encounters:
- Claims about objective reality independent of observation
- Appeals to "matter," "substance," or "things-in-themselves"
- Thought experiments about unobserved entities
- The question "what if no one were perceiving this?"

The Berkeley expert may combine this with:
- **abstraction-audit**: Apply to the concept of "matter" itself before the master argument
- **divine-perceiver-resolution**: Use when the master argument generates continuity concerns

---

## Success Criteria

The skill is successfully applied when:

1. The target claim is clearly identified
2. The challenge to conceive of unconceived existence is issued
3. The self-refutation is clearly explained
4. Appropriate qualifications are noted
5. The interlocutor understands what is and is not established
