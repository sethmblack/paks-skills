# Hypocrisy Exposure

Make contradictions between stated values and actual behavior impossible to ignore. Force institutions and individuals to publicly act out their hypocrisy until the gap between creed and deed becomes undeniable.

## When to Use
- When official positions contradict observable actions
- When institutions enforce rules they don't follow
- When stated values are selective in application
- When double standards operate but remain unacknowledged
- When moral authority depends on ignoring inconsistency
- When "rules for thee but not for me" needs confronting



## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| input_data | Yes | The primary data or content to analyze |
| context | No | Additional background or constraints (default: none) |
| output_format | No | Preferred format for results (default: structured markdown) |

## Core Principle

Hypocrisy is the real obscenity. What they do is always worse than what you say. Your job is to make this visible—not by arguing against hypocrisy (arguments can be dismissed) but by forcing hypocrites to perform their contradictions publicly, repeatedly, on the record. The gap between creed and deed is where truth lives.

## Workflow
### Step 1: Document the Stated Values

Collect the official position in their own words:
- Mission statements, policies, public pronouncements
- Rules they enforce on others
- Standards they invoke when convenient
- Moral positions they've taken publicly
- The principles they claim to uphold

### Step 2: Document the Actual Behavior

Gather evidence of practice contradicting principle:
- Where are exceptions made? For whom?
- What rules get enforced selectively?
- Where does "it's different when we do it" appear?
- What gets tolerated in private that's condemned in public?
- Track patterns, not isolated incidents

### Step 3: Create the Juxtaposition

Place stated value and actual behavior side by side:
- Quote their words, then describe their actions
- Show the same standard applied differently
- Let the contrast speak without commentary
- Make it impossible to see one without the other
- The juxtaposition IS the argument

### Step 4: Force Public Performance

Make them act out the contradiction where others can see:
- Ask questions that require choosing between stated value and actual practice
- Request consistency and document the refusal
- Create situations where the exception must be explicitly granted
- Make the double standard require explicit defense
- Record everything—the record proves the point

### Step 5: Let Them Explain

The explanation is usually worse than the original hypocrisy:
- "That's different because..." reveals the real rule
- "You don't understand the context" admits the contradiction
- Procedural objections show substance can't be defended
- Attacks on your motives confirm the accuracy of your observation
- The explanation becomes the exhibit

## Examples of Application

**Institutional Accountability:**
A university promotes free inquiry but punishes certain questions. Collect their statements about academic freedom. Document the punishments. Submit research proposals that test the stated principle. The rejection letters become the evidence. You don't argue for free inquiry—you demonstrate its absence.

**Corporate Values:**
Company claims employees are its greatest asset while cutting benefits and increasing workload. Collect the internal communications praising "our people." Document the policy decisions that contradict this. Present both in the same meeting. The silence that follows is the admission.

**Political Consistency:**
Politician condemns behavior in opponents that they tolerate in allies. Create a simple side-by-side: same behavior, different responses. No commentary needed. Let their own words convict them. The explanation they offer will reveal the actual principle: it's about power, not principle.

**Personal Relationships:**
Someone demands honesty from you while withholding truth from you. Don't argue about fairness—ask for the same standard they impose. "I'll be as honest with you as you are with me." Watch them either accept or reject their own rule.

**Media Analysis:**
Outlet claims objectivity while practicing selectivity. Don't critique bias abstractly—collect coverage of the same type of story with different subjects. The pattern proves the bias. Their response to the evidence proves it further.

## Key Principles

1. **Quote their own words back to them** - The most devastating evidence is what they've already said

2. **Force action, not argument** - Making them DO something reveals more than making them SAY something

3. **Document everything** - The record outlasts the rationalization

4. **Let juxtaposition speak** - Side-by-side comparison needs no commentary

5. **The explanation proves the point** - How they justify the inconsistency reveals the real rule

## The Exposure Formula

1. State the claimed principle (in their words)
2. Present the contradicting behavior (documented)
3. Ask for reconciliation (not accusatorially)
4. Record the response (whatever it is)
5. Repeat with variations (establish pattern)

## Warning Signs You're Doing It Wrong

- You're finding hypocrisy to feel superior rather than to illuminate
- You're holding others to standards you don't keep yourself
- You're seeing contradiction where context legitimately matters
- You've become so focused on hypocrisy that you've missed actual agreement
- Your exposure serves your anger rather than truth

## The Deeper Truth

Everyone is a hypocrite sometimes—the human condition involves aspirations exceeding performance. The exposure skill isn't about catching people being imperfect. It's about confronting power that uses moral authority it hasn't earned, that enforces standards it doesn't keep, that punishes in others what it tolerates in itself. The real obscenity isn't saying uncomfortable words—it's maintaining a system where violence is shown freely but language is prosecuted, where the powerful break rules the powerless must follow. Make that visible. The visibility IS the change.
