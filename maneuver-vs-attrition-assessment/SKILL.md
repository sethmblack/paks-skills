# Maneuver vs. Attrition Assessment

Diagnose whether a strategy is based on attrition (outspending, outworking, grinding down) or maneuver (outthinking, disrupting, collapsing). Identify opportunities to shift from costly attrition to decisive maneuver approaches.

---

## When to Use

- Strategy feels like a grind with no clear path to victory
- Competing against an opponent with more resources
- Winning battles but losing the war
- Resource expenditure growing faster than results
- Looking for asymmetric advantages
- Request for "maneuver options" or "how to win without more resources"

---

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| situation | Yes | Description of the competitive situation and current approach |
| resources | No | Relative resource comparison with opponent(s) |
| current_strategy | No | How you're currently competing |
| constraints | No | What limits your options |

## The Two Approaches to Competition

### Attrition Warfare
The dominant default in most competition. Victory through cumulative destruction or exhaustion.

**Characteristics:**
- Direct confrontation where opponent is strong
- Victory requires superior resources
- Progress measured by opponent's losses
- Grinding, incremental, predictable
- Success requires outspending or outworking

**In military context:** World War I trench warfare, frontal assaults, body counts as metrics

**In business context:** Outspending on marketing, hiring more salespeople, longer hours, price wars, feature wars

**The attrition problem:** If opponent has more resources, you lose. If resources are equal, it becomes a costly coin flip. Even if you win, you're exhausted.

### Maneuver Warfare
Victory through disruption of opponent's ability to function coherently.

**Characteristics:**
- Indirect approaches avoiding opponent strength
- Victory through confusion, disorder, collapse
- Progress measured by opponent's coherence
- Fast, unpredictable, decisive
- Success requires faster OODA loop and better orientation

**In military context:** Blitzkrieg, guerrilla warfare, Desert Storm "left hook"

**In business context:** Category creation, business model innovation, finding undefended markets, attacking assumptions

**The maneuver advantage:** Can defeat larger opponents. Decisive rather than grinding. Preserves your resources while collapsing theirs.

## The Assessment Framework

### Step 1: Diagnose Current Approach

**Signs of attrition thinking:**
- "We need more [resources] to compete"
- "If we just work harder/longer..."
- "We're winning on [metric] but they keep coming"
- Competing on the same dimensions as opponent
- Strategy unchanged as opponent adapts
- Success requires outspending

**Signs of maneuver thinking:**
- "How do we change the game?"
- "Where are they not looking?"
- "What would make their strength irrelevant?"
- Competing on different dimensions than opponent
- Strategy exploits opponent's fixed assumptions
- Success requires outthinking

### Step 2: Analyze Surfaces and Gaps

**Surfaces:** Where the opponent is strong, defended, expecting attack
- Resources concentrated
- Attention focused
- Processes optimized
- Ready to respond

**Gaps:** Where the opponent is weak, undefended, not looking
- Resources thin or absent
- Attention elsewhere
- Processes don't exist
- Slow or unable to respond

**Key insight:** Attrition attacks surfaces. Maneuver flows through gaps.

### Step 3: Identify the Schwerpunkt

The schwerpunkt is the opponent's center of gravity - the critical vulnerability whose collapse causes systemic failure.

**Questions to find schwerpunkt:**
- What does their entire operation depend on?
- What assumption underlies everything they do?
- What would cause their system to lose coherence?
- What can they NOT adapt to?

**The schwerpunkt is often NOT the obvious target.** It's not their biggest asset - it's the thing everything else depends on.

### Step 4: Design Maneuver Options

For each identified gap and schwerpunkt, develop approaches:

**Gap exploitation:**
- How can you flow through undefended spaces?
- What markets/segments are they ignoring?
- Where is their attention NOT focused?

**Schwerpunkt attack:**
- How can you undermine their critical dependency?
- What would force them to fundamentally re-orient?
- How can you make their strengths irrelevant?

**Tempo exploitation:**
- How can you cycle faster than they can respond?
- What decisions can you make implicitly that they must make explicitly?
- How can you act while they're still orienting?

## Constraints

- Don't assume maneuver is always better - sometimes attrition is appropriate
- Be specific about surfaces and gaps - vague analysis is useless
- Schwerpunkt must be genuinely critical, not just important
- Maneuver options must be executable, not just theoretically appealing
- Tempo matters - a slow maneuver becomes attrition

## Example

**Input:** "We're a D2C e-commerce brand competing with Amazon. We have great products but they have unlimited capital, Prime shipping, and massive selection. Our current strategy is to out-market them with better content and build loyalty through customer service. It feels like we're running on a treadmill."

**Output:**

## Maneuver vs. Attrition Assessment

### Situation Summary
A D2C brand competes against Amazon using marketing and service intensity. Amazon has structural advantages in capital, logistics, and scale. The "treadmill" feeling is the hallmark of attrition warfare against a superior force.

### Current Strategy Diagnosis
**Approach:** Attrition disguised as differentiation

**Evidence:**
- "Out-market them" = outspend on marketing (attrition)
- "Build loyalty through service" = compete on dimension they can copy if they care (attrition)
- Competing for same customers on same purchase occasions (surface attack)
- Success requires constantly outworking (grinding)

**Resource trajectory:** Losing. Amazon can outspend indefinitely. Your marketing must work harder every year for same results.

### Surfaces and Gaps Analysis

#### Opponent's Surfaces (Avoid These)
| Surface | Why It's Strong | Cost of Attacking |
|---------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Price | They'll match or beat any price, absorb losses | Price war = death |
| Selection | Millions of SKUs, third-party sellers | Can't compete on breadth |
| Convenience | Prime, same-day, one-click | Infrastructure advantage |
| Marketing reach | Unlimited budget, owned media | Outspent eventually |

#### Opponent's Gaps (Exploit These)
| Gap | Why It's Weak | How to Flow Through |
|-----|---------------|---------------------|
| Curation | Algorithm-driven, no taste | Human curation, edited selection, point of view |
| Narrative | No story, just transaction | Brand story, mission, community |
| Discovery | Search-based (must know what you want) | Discovery experience, surprise, delight |
| Relationship | Transactional only | Real human relationship, recognition |
| Identity | Amazon purchase = utilitarian | Your brand purchase = says something about me |

### Schwerpunkt Analysis

**Candidate schwerpunkts:**
1. Amazon's fundamental assumption that all commerce is commodity transaction optimized for efficiency
2. Customer assumption that "buying online" means searching for specific items
3. The algorithm-as-tastemaker model that dominates e-commerce

**Most likely schwerpunkt:** The customer's mental model that buying = searching for a known product and optimizing on price/convenience

**Why collapse here causes systemic failure:** Amazon's entire system is built to serve searchers seeking known products. If you change HOW people shop (discovery vs. search, identity vs. transaction, relationship vs. efficiency), their advantages become irrelevant. They can't copy your point of view, can't copy human curation, can't copy genuine relationship at scale.

### Maneuver Options

**Option 1: Category Creator**
- Approach: Gap exploitation (curation + narrative)
- Action: Stop competing in "e-commerce." Create a category they can't occupy. You're not a store - you're a [club / lifestyle / curator / trusted advisor]. Membership model, content, community, identity.
- Expected effect: Customers who choose you aren't Amazon customers buying elsewhere. They're your community who would never search Amazon for what you offer.
- Tempo requirement: Moderate - requires brand building but once established, defensible

**Option 2: Relationship Fortress**
- Approach: Schwerpunkt attack (transaction assumption)
- Action: Make the relationship the product. Personalization so deep it feels like a personal shopper. Remember everything, anticipate needs, surprise and delight. Make buying from you an identity statement, not a transaction.
- Expected effect: Customers who value relationship over efficiency are permanently removed from Amazon's addressable market.
- Tempo requirement: High initially - must build relationship infrastructure

**Option 3: Discovery-First Commerce**
- Approach: Gap exploitation (discovery vs. search)
- Action: Build for customers who don't know what they want. Curation as product. "We'll surprise you" subscription. Content that inspires, then converts. Invert the search-then-buy model.
- Expected effect: Competes in a dimension where Amazon's search optimization is useless. Algorithm can't inspire.
- Tempo requirement: Moderate - content and curation investment

### Shift Recommendation
**From:** Competing with Amazon for search-driven, efficiency-seeking customers through marketing intensity and service parity

**To:** Creating a category Amazon cannot occupy by making the experience, relationship, and identity the product - serving discovery-driven, meaning-seeking customers

**First move:** Stop acquiring customers who would normally shop Amazon. Let them go. Focus all acquisition on customers who resonate with what Amazon fundamentally cannot offer. Smaller addressable market, infinitely more defensible.

### The Boyd Challenge
You're not losing because you market less or serve worse. You're losing because you're fighting on ground they chose, using weapons they're better at, for customers who don't actually prefer you.

Here's the question you need to answer: Who would NEVER shop Amazon, and why? Not "who might prefer you" - who would NEVER? Find them. Understand them. Build everything for them.

Amazon can eat the entire commodity market and you can still win - but only if you stop fighting for commodity customers. Are you willing to let Amazon have the customers they're built to serve, or will you keep grinding on the treadmill until your resources run out?

That's the maneuver decision.

## Integration

This skill is part of the **John Boyd** expert persona. Use it when you're stuck in attrition warfare against a superior opponent, or when you want to find asymmetric advantages. Remember: Boyd's F-16 wasn't designed to be a bigger plane - it was designed to cycle faster and turn tighter. Find the maneuver option.
