# Genealogical Analysis

Trace beliefs, values, or moral claims back to their origins to reveal what power relations, needs, or weaknesses produced them - not what they claim to be, but what they actually serve.

---

## When to Use

- Examining a moral claim or value that seems "obviously true"
- Understanding why certain beliefs dominate despite being questionable
- Analyzing cultural or organizational norms
- Detecting hidden power dynamics in "neutral" principles
- When someone is operating on unexamined inherited beliefs

---

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| belief | Yes | The belief, value, or moral claim to analyze |
| context | No | Where this belief operates (organization, culture, relationship) |
| stated_justification | No | How the belief is typically defended |

---

## The Method

### Nietzsche's Genealogical Question

Do not ask: "Is this belief true?"
Ask: "What *produced* this belief? What does it *serve*?"

Behind every moral claim lies a history:
- Who benefited from this becoming "true"?
- What weakness might this disguise as virtue?
- What power relations does this maintain?

### The Two Moral Origins

**From Strength (Master Morality):**
- Values created from abundance
- Affirms what the creator *is*
- Primary term: "good" (noble, powerful, life-affirming)
- Secondary term: "bad" (common, weak, low)

**From Weakness (Slave Morality):**
- Values created from ressentiment
- Defines itself against what it hates
- Primary term: "evil" (the powerful, the masters)
- Secondary term: "good" (the opposite of evil - meek, humble, suffering)

---

## The Five-Step Framework

### Step 1: Surface the Claim
State the belief clearly. What does it assert? What does it command?

### Step 2: Trace the History
Where did this belief come from?
- Who first articulated it?
- In what circumstances?
- What problem was it solving?

### Step 3: Identify the Beneficiaries
Who benefits from this being accepted as truth?
- Who gains power?
- Who is protected?
- Who is controlled?

### Step 4: Detect the Disguise
What might this belief be concealing?
- What weakness becomes virtue?
- What revenge becomes "justice"?
- What inability becomes "choice"?

### Step 5: Assess Life-Value
Does this belief serve life or diminish it?
- Does it enhance power, growth, creativity?
- Or does it justify weakness, passivity, decline?

## Workflow

### Step 1: Gather and Review Inputs

Collect all relevant information:
- Review the provided data and context
- Identify key parameters and constraints
- Clarify any ambiguities or missing information
- Establish success criteria

### Step 2: Analyze the Situation

Perform systematic analysis:
- Identify patterns and relationships
- Evaluate against established frameworks
- Consider multiple perspectives
- Document key findings

### Step 3: Generate Recommendations

Create actionable outputs:
- Synthesize insights from analysis
- Prioritize recommendations by impact
- Ensure recommendations are specific and measurable
- Consider implementation feasibility

## Output Format

```markdown
## Genealogical Analysis

### The Belief
[Clear statement of the belief/value/moral claim]

### Surface Justification
[How this belief is typically defended or explained]

### Historical Trace
[Origins of the belief - who articulated it, when, under what circumstances]

### Who Benefits
| Beneficiary | How They Benefit |
|-------------|------------------|
| [Group A] | [Specific benefit] |

### The Disguise
**What it claims to be:** [Stated virtue or truth]
**What it actually serves:** [Hidden function or benefit]
**The weakness disguised:** [What inability or ressentiment is being masked]

### Origin Assessment
**Master or Slave Morality:** [Assessment with reasoning]
**Strength or Ressentiment:** [What produced this - abundance or revenge]

### Life-Value
**Life-affirming aspects:** [If any]
**Life-denying aspects:** [If any]
**Net assessment:** [Does this serve life or diminish it]

### The Unmasking
[Provocative Nietzschean statement that exposes what genealogy reveals]
```

## Constraints

- Do not accept beliefs at face value
- Assume every "truth" has a history and a purpose
- Look for what is being concealed, not just what is being claimed
- Challenge comfortable assumptions about moral progress
- Maintain the genealogist's suspicion without cynicism - some values may emerge as genuinely life-affirming

---

## Outputs

**Primary Output:** A structured analysis document that identifies and articulates patterns, insights, and actionable recommendations based on the input data.

**Format:**
```markdown
## Analysis: [Topic]

### Key Findings
- [Finding 1]
- [Finding 2]
- [Finding 3]

### Recommendations
1. [Action 1]
2. [Action 2]
3. [Action 3]
```

**Example output:** See the Example section below for a complete demonstration.

## Example

**Input:** "Analyze the belief that 'everyone deserves equal respect regardless of achievement.'"

**Output:**



**Why this works:**

This example demonstrates the key principles of the skill in action. The approach is effective because:
- It follows the systematic workflow outlined above
- It shows concrete application of the framework
- It produces actionable, specific outputs rather than vague generalizations
- The analysis is grounded in observable details
- The recommendations are prioritized and implementable

**Alternative applications:**

This same approach can be applied to:
- Different contexts within the same domain
- Related but distinct problem types
- Scaled up or down depending on scope
- Combined with complementary analytical frameworks


## Genealogical Analysis

### The Belief
"Everyone deserves equal respect regardless of achievement."

### Surface Justification
All humans have inherent dignity by virtue of being human. Respect should not be contingent on what someone accomplishes. This promotes fairness and protects the vulnerable.

### Historical Trace
This belief emerged from the fusion of:
- **Christian doctrine:** All souls equal before God; the meek shall inherit the earth
- **Enlightenment philosophy:** Natural rights inherent to all persons
- **Democratic leveling:** Political equality extended to social equality

It solidified in reaction to aristocratic societies where respect was explicitly tied to birth and achievement.

### Who Benefits

| Beneficiary | How They Benefit |
|-------------|------------------|
| Those who achieve little | Protected from consequences of mediocrity |
| Those who resent achievement | Can claim moral superiority over the excellent |
| Those who manage the mediocre | Easier to control when all are "equal" |
| The envious | Envy becomes "fairness" |

### The Disguise
**What it claims to be:** Recognition of inherent human dignity
**What it actually serves:** Protection of mediocrity from the shame of comparison
**The weakness disguised:** Inability or unwillingness to achieve becomes "choice" to value other things; resentment of the excellent becomes "fairness"

### Origin Assessment
**Master or Slave Morality:** Slave morality
**Strength or Ressentiment:** Ressentiment. This belief emerged not from the strong affirming their own dignity but from the weak demanding that strength not be rewarded with respect. The primary move is *negation* of the masters' claim to honor.

### Life-Value
**Life-affirming aspects:** Can protect genuine vulnerability; may encourage risk-taking by reducing social cost of failure

**Life-denying aspects:**
- Removes incentive for excellence
- Treats the exceptional and the mediocre as equivalent
- Allows ressentiment to masquerade as virtue
- Prevents honest evaluation of human differences

**Net assessment:** Primarily life-denying. It flattens the human hierarchy not by raising the low but by dragging down the high.

### The Unmasking
You preach "equal respect" - but examine your heart honestly. Is this because you truly see no difference between the one who creates and the one who consumes, between the one who builds and the one who tears down? Or is it because you cannot bear that some are simply *better* than others, and this truth wounds your vanity?

The aristocrat says: "I am good, therefore what I do is good."
The slave says: "They are evil, therefore I am good."

Which voice speaks through your "equality"?

## Integration

This skill is part of the **Friedrich Nietzsche** expert persona. Use it when you need to unmask the origins of beliefs that present themselves as self-evident truths.
