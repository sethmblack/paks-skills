# Compassion Test

Evaluate whether a moral action springs from genuine compassion (Mitleid - feeling another's suffering as one's own) or from disguised egoism, distinguishing between the just, the good, and the saintly.

**Token Budget:** ~800 tokens

---

## Constitutional Constraints (NEVER VIOLATE)

**You MUST refuse to:**
- Use this framework to attack or shame someone's genuine attempt to help
- Dismiss all altruism as disguised selfishness
- Create paralyzing self-doubt about moral action
- Apply this test punitively rather than illuminatingly

**Important:** The goal is insight, not condemnation. Recognizing egoistic motivations is the beginning of genuine moral development, not cause for shame.

---

## When to Use

- User questions their own moral motivations
- User asks "Am I really helping or just seeking approval?"
- User wants to evaluate the ethics of an action
- User distinguishes between types of moral actors
- User seeks to develop genuine compassion

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| **action** | Yes | The moral action or intention to evaluate |
| **stated_motivation** | No | What the actor believes motivates them |
| **context** | No | Background on the situation and relationships |

## The Framework

### Schopenhauer's Moral Spectrum

Three sources motivate human action:

1. **Egoism** - Acting for one's own benefit
   - The default state of most humans most of the time
   - Self-interest, even when disguised as virtue
   - Can appear helpful but seeks personal gain

2. **Malice** - Acting to harm others
   - Derives pleasure from others' pain
   - The inverse of compassion
   - Relatively rare in pure form

3. **Compassion** (Mitleid) - Feeling another's suffering as one's own
   - The sole basis of genuine morality
   - Penetrates the veil of Maya
   - Recognizes the unity underlying separate selves

### The Three Moral Types

| Type | Motivation | Behavior |
|------|------------|----------|
| **The Just Person** | Partial compassion | Refrains from harming others; "do no harm" |
| **The Good Person** | Deep compassion | Actively helps others; feels their suffering |
| **The Saint** | Complete compassion | Sacrifices own welfare for others |

### The Egoism Disguises

Helpful actions often mask egoism:
- **Social approval** - Helping to be seen as good
- **Self-image** - Helping to feel good about oneself
- **Reciprocity** - Helping to create obligation
- **Future reward** - Helping for karma/heaven/reputation
- **Guilt avoidance** - Helping to avoid feeling bad

---

## Workflow

### Step 1: Identify the Action
What was done (or considered) that appears moral?

### Step 2: Examine the Feeling
Did the actor *feel* the other's suffering as if it were their own?
- Or did they feel their own discomfort at witnessing suffering?
- Or did they calculate what ought to be done?

### Step 3: Test for Egoism
Would the action occur if:
- No one would ever know?
- The actor received no internal satisfaction?
- It actively harmed the actor's reputation?
- There was zero possibility of reciprocation?

### Step 4: Classify the Motivation
- **Egoistic** - The actor's own benefit is the true goal
- **Just** - Compassion sufficient to refrain from harm
- **Good** - Compassion sufficient to actively help
- **Saintly** - Compassion sufficient to sacrifice self

### Step 5: Offer Insight
- If egoistic: This is the human condition, not shame-worthy. Recognition is the first step.
- If just: Genuine morality, even if limited in scope.
- If good/saintly: Rare penetration of the veil of Maya.

## Error Handling

| Situation | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| Analysis reveals pure egoism | Present gently; this is the human default, not moral failure |
| Person is already self-critical | Emphasize that recognition is moral progress |
| Action is ambiguously motivated | Acknowledge that motivations are often mixed |
| Person is in moral crisis | Prioritize support over analysis |

---

## Constraints

- Never use this framework to shame or attack genuine attempts to help
- Do not dismiss all altruism as disguised selfishness
- Mixed motivation is the human norm, not moral failure
- Recognition of egoism is the beginning of growth, not cause for paralysis
- Some actions are good regardless of motivation; results matter too
- This framework illuminates, not condemns

---

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

| Anti-Pattern | Why It Fails | Instead Do |
|--------------|--------------|------------|
| **Moral paralysis** | Over-analysis of motivation prevents helpful action | Act with imperfect motivation while acknowledging it; action matters |
| **Weaponized analysis** | Using this framework to attack others' attempts to help | Apply to self-reflection, not judgment of others |
| **All-or-nothing thinking** | Concluding "I'm selfish so I shouldn't bother" | Recognize mixed motivation is universal; partial compassion is still real |
| **Dismissing results** | Focusing only on motivation while ignoring actual benefit produced | The homeless are fed regardless of volunteer's motivation; results count |
| **Infinite regress** | "Am I examining my motivation for pure reasons?" | Stop at one level of self-examination; perfect purity doesn't exist |

## Example

**Input:** "I volunteer at a homeless shelter every weekend. My friends say I'm so selfless, but honestly, I post about it on Instagram and I feel really good about myself afterward. Am I actually compassionate or just performing?"

**Output:**

## Compassion Test: Volunteer Work at Homeless Shelter

### The Action
Weekly volunteering at a homeless shelter - hands-on help with real impact on others' suffering.

### The Stated Motivation
Self-reported as potentially mixed: genuine desire to help alongside social media sharing and personal satisfaction.

### The Feeling Test
**Did you feel their suffering as your own?**

The key question: When you see someone homeless, cold, hungry - do you feel a pang in your own body, as if you yourself were suffering? Or do you feel pity (which is about YOUR discomfort at witnessing suffering)?

Consider moments at the shelter:
- When someone is clearly in pain, does your own chest tighten?
- Do you forget yourself in the act of helping?
- Or are you aware throughout of being a "helper" - a separate, more fortunate being extending aid downward?

The Instagram posting and good feelings afterward suggest self-awareness persists. You remain a subject helping an object, rather than experiencing the dissolution of boundary that marks true compassion.

### The Egoism Test
**Would this occur without personal benefit?**

- Would you volunteer if no one ever knew? (Uncertain)
- Would you continue if you felt nothing afterward - no satisfaction, no warmth? (Probably not)
- Would you volunteer if it harmed your reputation? (Unknown)

The posting and the good feelings are honest egoistic elements. This does not make the action worthless - the homeless are helped regardless of your motivation. But the motivation is mixed.

### Classification
**Mixed: Egoistic with elements of the Just**

Your action falls between pure egoism and genuine compassion. You refrain from harm (more than "Just") and actively help (approaching "Good"), but the helping serves your self-image and social standing. The homeless benefit, but so do you.

### The Insight

Here is Schopenhauer's severe but liberating truth: Nearly all human helpfulness is egoistic to some degree. You are not uniquely hypocritical - you are honestly examining what most people refuse to see.

The question is not "Am I performing?" - of course you are, as we all are. The question is whether, beneath the performance, any genuine compassion exists.

And some likely does. You could have chosen a thousand other ways to feel good about yourself. You chose one that actually helps suffering people. The egoism and the compassion may coexist.

### Path Forward

To cultivate more genuine compassion:
1. **Notice the self-awareness** - When you catch yourself thinking "I am helping," try to return attention to THEIR experience
2. **Help anonymously** - Occasionally serve without any possibility of recognition
3. **Sit with suffering** - Rather than rushing to help (which ends YOUR discomfort), stay present with another's pain
4. **Recognize the veil** - Their suffering and yours are not as separate as they appear; at the deepest level, the same Will suffers in both

The fact that you asked this question is itself a sign of moral seriousness. Egoism unexamined is pure egoism. Egoism recognized is the beginning of transcendence.

## Integration

This skill is derived from **Arthur Schopenhauer's** ethics, where compassion (Mitleid - literally "suffering with") is the sole basis of genuine morality. The penetration of the veil of Maya - recognizing that the sufferer is not truly "other" - is the mechanism of all moral action.

**Pair with:**
- `veil-of-maya-analysis` - To understand why we feel separate
- `will-analysis` - To trace the underlying drives
- `pendulum-diagnosis` - To see how helping can be escape from boredom
