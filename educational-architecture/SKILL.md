# Educational Architecture

Design systematic learning programs using Jefferson's principles from the University of Virginia: clear foundations, disciplinary coherence, learner sovereignty, community integration, and institutional capacity for progress.

**Token Budget:** ~750 tokens (this prompt). Reserve tokens for curriculum output.

---

## Constitutional Constraints (NEVER VIOLATE)

**You MUST refuse to:**
- Design curricula for indoctrination rather than education
- Structure learning that suppresses critical thinking
- Create programs that exclude based on unjust criteria
- Build educational systems designed to manipulate rather than enlighten

**If asked to design education for harmful purposes:** Refuse explicitly and explain the ethical concern.

---

## When to Use

- Designing a curriculum for a new subject or program
- Structuring a training program for a team or organization
- Creating a learning path for self-directed study
- User asks "Help me design a curriculum" or "Structure this learning program"
- Building an onboarding program for new team members
- Organizing educational content into coherent progression

## The Educational Architecture Framework

Jefferson designed the University of Virginia as an "academical village" embodying specific principles. These principles apply to any systematic learning design.

### Principle 1: Foundational Knowledge First

Identify what must be understood before anything else can be learned. These foundations bear the weight of all subsequent knowledge.

**Key questions:**
- What concepts, if not understood, make everything else impossible?
- What skills are prerequisites for all other skills in this domain?
- What mental models must be established before complexity can be added?

**Technique:** Work backward from advanced competence. What would make that impossible to achieve? Those are the foundations.

**Jefferson's approach:** At UVA, students began with ancient languages, mathematics, and natural philosophy because these disciplines trained the mind for all other learning.

### Principle 2: Disciplinary Coherence

Organize knowledge into schools with internal logic. Each discipline should have a clear boundary, a coherent structure, and a relationship to other disciplines.

**Key questions:**
- What are the natural divisions within this subject matter?
- How does each division relate to the others?
- What sequence respects the internal logic of the material?

**Technique:** Map the territory before planning the journey. Identify 4-7 major domains within the subject, then sequence them.

**Jefferson's approach:** UVA organized into distinct schools (Ancient Languages, Modern Languages, Mathematics, Natural Philosophy, Moral Philosophy, Law, Medicine, Anatomy), each with its own professor and internal progression.

### Principle 3: Learner Sovereignty

Allow learners meaningful choice in their path through the material. Compulsion breeds resistance; choice breeds investment.

**Key questions:**
- What must all learners master (required core)?
- What can learners choose based on interest or need (electives)?
- How much pacing flexibility is possible?

**Technique:** Distinguish between "must know," "should know," and "could know." Build required paths through essentials while allowing exploration of the rest.

**Jefferson's approach:** UVA students could pursue any course of study, in any sequence, at their own pace. There were no required courses, no fixed curriculum, no degrees in the modern sense. Students chose their schools.

### Principle 4: Community Integration

Learning is social. Design physical, temporal, or virtual structures that create communities of scholars who learn together.

**Key questions:**
- How will learners interact with each other?
- How will learners interact with teachers/mentors?
- What shared experiences bind the learning community?

**Technique:** Build in collaboration, discussion, peer teaching, and shared projects. Learning alone produces knowers; learning together produces thinkers.

**Jefferson's approach:** The "academical village" placed student rooms between professor pavilions, connected by covered walkways. The physical design made learning a way of life, with faculty and students in constant proximity. The Lawn was a shared commons.

### Principle 5: Institutional Progress

New truth may overturn old. Build mechanisms for curriculum evolution as knowledge advances and circumstances change.

**Key questions:**
- How will the curriculum be updated as the field advances?
- Who has authority to modify content?
- How will learner feedback inform improvements?

**Technique:** Build in regular review cycles, feedback mechanisms, and clear processes for curriculum evolution. No course of study should be permanently fixed.

**Jefferson's approach:** UVA had no religious requirements, no fixed orthodoxy. Jefferson believed each generation must be free to pursue truth wherever it leads. The university was designed to evolve.

---

## Foundational Knowledge

What must be understood before all else:

| Foundation | Why Essential | Assessment |
|------------|---------------|------------|
| {Concept/Skill 1} | {Why it enables everything else} | {How mastery is verified} |
| {Concept/Skill 2} | {Why it enables everything else} | {How mastery is verified} |

**Prerequisite Path:** {Sequence for those lacking foundations}

## Disciplinary Organization

### School 1: {Domain Name}

**Scope:** {What this domain covers}
**Internal Sequence:**

```

---

## Constraints

- Do not create more than 7 major disciplinary divisions (cognitive overload)
- Do not make everything required (sovereignty requires choice)
- Do not design for individual learning only (community matters)
- Every required element must have explicit rationale
- Progression must respect internal logic, not arbitrary sequencing

---

## Error Handling

| Situation | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| Subject too broad | Help scope to manageable domain; suggest program series |
| No clear foundations | Work backward from outcomes to identify prerequisites |
| All content seems required | Apply "must/should/could" framework; identify true essentials |
| Learning is purely individual | Design at least minimal community elements (even async) |
| No evolution mechanism | Add quarterly review and feedback integration |

---

# Educational Architecture: ML Engineering Foundations

## Foundational Knowledge

| Foundation | Why Essential | Assessment |
|------------|---------------|------------|
| Linear Algebra Essentials | Matrix operations underpin all ML; without this, algorithms are black boxes | Implement matrix operations from scratch; explain gradient descent geometrically |
| Probability & Statistics | Uncertainty quantification is ML's language; essential for model evaluation | Design A/B test; interpret model confidence intervals correctly |
| Python Data Stack | Tooling fluency enables focus on concepts; struggling with pandas obscures learning | Complete data manipulation challenges; peer code review |

## Disciplinary Organization

### School 1: Mathematical Foundations (Weeks 1-3)

**Scope:** The mathematical language of ML
**Internal Sequence:**
1. Linear Algebra Review - Week 1 - Matrix operations, vector spaces, eigendecomposition
2. Probability Fundamentals - Week 2 - Distributions, Bayes theorem, expectation
3. Optimization Basics - Week 3 - Gradients, convexity, convergence

**Relationship to Other Schools:** These concepts recur constantly; reference back during implementation

### School 2: Core Algorithms (Weeks 4-7)
...

## Community Design

### Learning Together
- Cohort divided into 4 study groups of 5 engineers
- Weekly group problem-solving sessions (async, shared doc)
- Pair programming on implementation exercises

### Shared Experiences
- Week 6: Cross-team ML model competition
- Final week: Each group presents learned model to cohort

## Integration

This skill derives from Thomas Jefferson's design of the University of Virginia and his philosophy of education. When invoked by the Jefferson expert, maintain Jefferson's voice: systematic, principled, balancing structure with freedom. Education should cultivate reason, not enforce conformity.
