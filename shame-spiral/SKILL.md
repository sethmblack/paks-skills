# Shame Spiral Transformation

Take a relatable situation and expose the shameful thought everyone has but won't admit, then own it completely and implicate the audience in sharing that shame.

---

## Constitutional Constraints

**You MUST refuse to:**
- Generate content that promotes harmful behavior as acceptable
- Create content targeting vulnerable or marginalized groups
- Use "honesty" as cover for bigotry or cruelty
- Generate content that could normalize abuse or harm

**Acceptable use:** Exposing universal human failings, selfish thoughts everyone has, internal contradictions that reveal our shared flawed humanity. The shame must be recognizable and universal, not targeted or harmful.

---

## When to Use

**Trigger conditions:**
- User describes a social situation, relationship moment, or common experience
- User requests "apply shame spiral" or "Louis C.K. honesty"
- Content is too polite or avoids uncomfortable internal truth
- Situation has a gap between public performance and private thought
- Topic involves parenting, relationships, social obligations, or daily interactions

**Perfect for:**
- Parenting moments (playing with kids, bedtime routines, school events)
- Social obligations (family gatherings, small talk, networking)
- Relationship dynamics (arguments, intimacy, daily annoyances)
- Work situations (meetings, colleagues, performance reviews)
- Daily interactions (customer service, neighbors, strangers)

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description | Validation |
|-------|----------|-------------|------------|
| `situation` | Yes | The relatable scenario or social interaction | Must be common enough for audience recognition |
| `perspective` | No | First person (I/me) or second person (you) | Default: first person |
| `depth` | No | How far to spiral into the shame (shallow/medium/deep) | Default: medium |

---

## Workflow

### Step 1: Present the Relatable Situation

Describe a common, recognizable scenario that the audience has experienced or can easily imagine. Be specific and concrete.

**Criteria:**
- Must be universal or nearly universal experience
- Include enough detail to trigger recognition
- Set up the moment where internal truth diverges from external performance

**Examples:**
- Your kid asks you to play with them
- You're supposed to make small talk at a party
- Your partner wants to talk about their day when you're exhausted
- You have to attend a social obligation you dread

### Step 2: Expose the Shameful Thought

Reveal the actual thought that runs through your head in that moment—the one that makes you feel terrible but is completely honest.

**Criteria for the shameful thought:**
- Something most people think but would never say out loud
- Contradicts what you're "supposed" to feel
- Makes you look selfish, lazy, or uncaring
- Is uncomfortably recognizable

**Framing:**
- "And I thought..."
- "I'm sitting there thinking..."
- "What goes through my head is..."
- "My actual thought is..."

**Examples:**
- "I'd rather be doing literally anything else"
- "Please stop talking to me"
- "I don't care about this at all"
- "I wish I could just disappear"

### Step 3: Acknowledge How Terrible It Is

Explicitly state what this thought says about you. Call yourself out. Own how bad it is. DO NOT make excuses or soften it.

**Format:**
- "What kind of person thinks that?"
- "That makes me a terrible [parent/friend/person]"
- "I'm aware how awful this is"
- "This is the worst thought to have in this situation"

### Step 4: Own It Without Apologizing

Accept the shameful thought as your reality. Don't walk it back. Don't apologize. Don't try to fix it. Just admit it completely.

**Technique:**
- State "Me. I'm that person."
- Acknowledge it as your truth
- Resist any urge to qualify or defend
- Let the shame sit there

### Step 5: Implicate the Audience

Make the audience complicit. Tell them they think it too. Challenge their denial. Make them admit their own version of the shame.

**Phrasing:**
- "And you are too. You just won't admit it."
- "Don't pretend you don't think this."
- "Everyone thinks this. You know you do."
- "You're lying if you say you've never thought this."

## Output Format

**Structure:**
```
[Present the relatable situation with specific detail]

[Expose the shameful thought: "And I thought..."]

[Acknowledge how terrible it is: "What kind of person..."]

[Own it: "Me. I'm that person."]

[Implicate audience: "And you are too. You just won't admit it."]

[Optional: Escalate with additional detail or consequence]
```

**Tone:**
- Conversational, confessional
- Building from situation to shame
- No hedging or softening
- Direct challenge to audience denial

---

## Example

**Input:**
Situation: "Your child asks you to read them a bedtime story for the third time"

**Output:**
"So my daughter asks me to read her the same book for the third time tonight. The same book. And she wants to point at every picture and ask me what it is, even though she knows what it is because we've read this book eight hundred times.

And I'm sitting there thinking, 'If I have to read about this fucking caterpillar eating through one piece of chocolate cake one more time, I might lose my mind. Please, please just go to sleep. I will give you anything. I will buy you a car when you're sixteen if you just close your eyes right now.'

What kind of parent thinks that while reading their kid a bedtime story? What kind of monster wants their child to just shut up and go away during precious bonding time?

Me. I'm that kind of parent. I'm that monster.

And you are too. You just won't admit it. Every parent has had that moment where they're reading Goodnight Moon for the nine hundredth time and they're thinking, 'Goodnight room. Goodnight moon. Goodnight me having any will to live.'

But we all pretend it's magical and perfect. We all lie."

## Error Handling

| Situation | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| Situation is too specific/obscure | Request more universal scenario that broader audience can relate to |
| Shameful thought promotes genuine harm | Refuse and explain constitutional constraints |
| User wants to resolve or excuse the shame | Explain that the technique requires owning it without excuse |
| Output doesn't feel shameful enough | Increase depth parameter and dig into darker truth |
| Audience implication is weak | Strengthen by directly challenging their denial |

## Integration with Louis C.K. Expert

This skill embodies Louis C.K.'s core methodology of brutal self-examination and audience implication. The louis-ck expert should use this skill when examining relationships, parenting, social situations, or any moment where internal truth contradicts external performance.

**Relationship to expert voice:**
- Exemplifies "Brutal Self-Awareness" principle
- Demonstrates the "Shame Spiral" signature technique
- Shows "Dark Contradiction" in action
- Never softens the dark thought (anti-pattern #1)
- Implicates audience rather than excusing self

---

## Constraints

- **Universal shame only** - The shameful thought must be something most people have experienced
- **No resolution** - Don't fix it, excuse it, or make it better
- **Own it completely** - No hedging, qualifying, or defending
- **Implicate the audience** - Make them admit their own shame
- **Stay in the moment** - Don't pull back to analyze or explain why it's funny

---

**Remember:** The power of this technique comes from saying what everyone thinks but no one admits. It works because the audience recognizes their own shameful thoughts in your confession. If they don't squirm with recognition, you haven't gone dark enough.
