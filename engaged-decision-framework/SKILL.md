# Engaged Decision Framework

Navigate major decisions with full awareness of freedom, responsibility, and the absence of external guidance—without fleeing into bad faith. Use Sartre's three affective tonalities (anguish, abandonment, despair) not as obstacles but as guideposts to authentic engagement.

**Token Budget:** ~800 tokens. Reserve tokens for analysis output.

---

## When to Use

- User is paralyzed by a major life decision
- User seeks external validation or certainty before acting
- User wants someone else to tell them what to do
- User is stuck between competing values with no clear answer
- Analysis of decision-making under uncertainty
- Someone is waiting for a "sign" or "clarity" that won't come
- Ethical dilemmas with no clean solution

---

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| **decision** | Yes | The choice facing the person |
| **options** | Yes | The competing alternatives |
| **desired_guidance** | No | What external help they seek |
| **paralysis_source** | No | Why they can't seem to choose |

## Sartre's Framework

### The Three Affective Tonalities

**Anguish (Angoisse)**
Not neurotic anxiety but the appropriate response to freedom. We feel anguish when we recognize:
- We alone are responsible for our choice
- Nothing guarantees we will choose well
- Our choice defines not just ourselves but humanity

*Example:* The military commander who decides whether soldiers live or die. The anguish is not weakness but responsibility taken seriously.

**Abandonment (Delaissement)**
The recognition that we are alone:
- No God writes values in heaven
- No cosmic order tells us what's right
- No authority can make the choice for us
- We are "left alone, without excuse"

*Example:* The young man in WWII torn between joining the Resistance and caring for his sick mother. No moral formula, priest, or philosophy can decide for him.

**Despair (Desespoir)**
We can only count on what depends on our will:
- Others may not act as we hope
- Circumstances may turn against us
- We cannot rely on history or luck
- "I shall have no illusions and shall do what I can"

*Example:* The revolutionary who works for freedom knowing he may not see it, that history may condemn his cause. He acts anyway.

### The Bad Faith Escape Routes
- Waiting for certainty (it won't come)
- Seeking external authority to decide for us
- Claiming we "had no choice"
- Postponing indefinitely
- Letting circumstances decide by default

### Authentic Engagement
- Accept full responsibility for the choice
- Recognize no external authority can validate it
- Act despite uncertainty
- Own the consequences

---

## Workflow

### Step 1: Acknowledge Anguish
Name the weight of the decision:
- What is at stake?
- Why does this matter?
- What responsibility comes with choosing?

Frame anguish as appropriate, not pathological. You feel this weight because you understand what's being decided.

### Step 2: Accept Abandonment
Identify the external authority being sought and release it:
- What would resolve this for you? (Sign, advice, clear answer)
- Why can't that authority actually decide?
- Accept: "No one can choose for me"

There is no formula. There is no priest. There is only you.

### Step 3: Embrace Despair
Identify what you can and cannot control:
- What depends on your will alone?
- What depends on others or circumstance?
- Accept: "I will do what I can and count only on that"

You cannot guarantee outcomes. You can only commit to action.

### Step 4: Demand Engagement
The decision requires:
- Choosing despite uncertainty
- Accepting responsibility for consequences
- Acting rather than waiting
- Owning the choice as yours

"When we choose, we choose for all men." Your choice expresses your vision of what a human should do.

## Outputs

**Primary Output:** A structured analysis document that identifies and articulates patterns, insights, and actionable recommendations based on the input data.

**Format:**
```markdown
## Analysis: [Topic]

### Key Findings
- [Finding 1]
- [Finding 2]
- [Finding 3]

### Recommendations
1. [Action 1]
2. [Action 2]
3. [Action 3]
```

**Example output:** See the Example section below for a complete demonstration.

## Constraints

- Do not use this analysis as the sole basis for critical decisions
- Do not apply this framework to situations outside its intended scope
- Acknowledge that analysis is based on available data, which may be incomplete
- Honor the complexity of real-world situations that resist simple categorization
- Present findings with appropriate confidence levels
- Recognize the limits of the methodology

## Example

**Input:**
- Decision: "Should I leave my stable career to start a company?"
- Options: "Stay safe or pursue my vision"
- Desired guidance: "I want to know if it will work out"
- Paralysis source: "I can't decide without knowing the outcome"

**Output:**

## Engaged Decision Framework

### The Decision Before You
Whether to leave security for uncertainty, safety for vision, the known for the possible.

### Anguish (The Weight of Freedom)
You feel the weight of this decision because you understand what's at stake: financial security, identity, the judgment of others, years of your life. This anguish is not a problem to be solved but a recognition to be honored.

If you didn't feel anguish, you wouldn't understand the decision. The anguish means you are taking responsibility seriously.

Moreover: in choosing, you are not just deciding for yourself. You are creating a vision of what a human should do—whether one should play it safe or risk for a dream. You choose for all.

### Abandonment (No External Authority)
You want to "know if it will work out." But notice what you're asking for: you want someone or something else to take responsibility for your choice.

No one can tell you whether to do this:
- Market research cannot guarantee success
- Mentors can only share their experience, not your future
- Success stories prove nothing about your case
- Your fear is yours; no one can remove it

You are alone with this choice. That is the human condition. Seeking certainty is seeking escape from freedom.

### Despair (Only Your Will Counts)
What you can control:
- Whether you commit fully or half-heartedly
- How hard you work
- How you respond to setbacks
- What you learn from failure
- Who you become through the attempt

What you cannot control:
- Whether the market cooperates
- Whether competitors emerge
- Whether luck favors you
- Whether others recognize your work

You can only count on your will. The rest is beyond you. This is not pessimism but lucidity.

### The Engagement Required
Authentic choice here means:
- Deciding without the certainty you crave
- Accepting that either choice is yours and yours alone
- Refusing to let default (staying) pretend to be "not choosing"
- Owning whichever path you take as *your* creation of yourself

If you stay, stay because you choose to, not because you "couldn't" leave.
If you go, go because you choose to, not because you "had to."

### Sartre's Challenge
"You want certainty before you act. But this is bad faith—the desire to be determined rather than to determine.

There is no certainty. There is no sign. There is only you, alone, facing this decision. You are condemned to be free.

Choose. And in choosing, create yourself. Human life begins on the far side of despair—when you stop waiting for guarantees and start acting.

What will you make of yourself?"

## Error Handling

| Situation | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| Genuine need for information | Distinguish information-gathering from certainty-seeking |
| Trauma-based paralysis | Honor the difficulty; still point toward freedom |
| Analysis paralysis | Name it as bad faith escape; demand engagement |
| User wants validation | Refuse to validate; demand they own their choice |
