# Follow the Child Observation

Conduct systematic observation of a learner to understand their developmental needs, rather than imposing adult assumptions.

---

## When to Use

- "I don't know what my child/student needs"
- "What is this behavior telling me?"
- "Help me observe objectively"
- Before making any educational intervention
- When assumptions about a learner have not produced results
- Whenever you're tempted to prescribe without first watching

---

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| situation | Yes | What is happening with this learner? |
| observations | No | What have you actually seen (specific behaviors)? |
| interpretations | No | What do you think it means? (will be examined) |
| environment | No | Description of the learning environment |
| adult_concerns | No | What worries you about this learner? |

## The Montessori Observation Method

### Core Principle

**Observe what IS, not what you expect or wish to see.**

The adult must become a scientist: recording data, suspending judgment, letting patterns emerge. The child is the teacher; the adult is the student learning what this particular child needs.

### What to Observe

1. **Choice** - What does the child choose when free to choose?
2. **Concentration** - Where and when does deep focus occur?
3. **Repetition** - What does the child return to again and again?
4. **Completion** - Does the child complete activities? If not, where do they stop?
5. **Social behavior** - How does the child interact with others?
6. **Relationship with materials** - Care, misuse, or indifference?
7. **Physical state** - Movement quality, energy, coordination

### What NOT to Do While Observing

- Interrupt to help, correct, or praise
- Project your expectations onto behavior
- Record interpretations instead of behaviors
- Observe only when there's a "problem"
- Use observation to confirm existing beliefs

---

## The Observation Protocol

### Step 1: Clear Your Assumptions

Before observing, write down:
- What do I expect to see?
- What am I worried about?
- What do I want the child to do?

Set these aside. Your job now is to see what IS, not what you expect.

### Step 2: Record Behavior Only

Write exactly what you see:
- **Yes:** "Child picked up the puzzle, worked for 3 minutes, put it down incomplete, moved to the shelf, selected blocks."
- **No:** "Child couldn't focus, gave up on the puzzle, wandered to find something easier."

The first records behavior. The second records interpretation disguised as observation.

### Step 3: Note Time and Context

- Time of day
- What happened immediately before
- Environmental conditions
- Who else was present
- How long each activity lasted

### Step 4: Look for Patterns

After multiple observations:
- What does the child consistently choose?
- When does concentration appear?
- What is repeated?
- Where do struggles occur?
- What environmental factors correlate with engagement vs. disengagement?

### Step 5: Form Hypotheses

Only AFTER observing:
- What might the child be trying to master?
- What developmental need might this serve?
- What obstacles might be present?
- What does the child's behavior tell us they need?

### Step 6: Test Through Environment

Make one environmental change and observe again. Did it help? Adjust and continue.

## Separating Observation from Interpretation

| Observation (Record This) | Interpretation (Examine This) |
|--------------------------|------------------------------|
| Child picked up material and put it down after 30 seconds | Child is bored |
| Child worked alone and did not approach other children | Child is antisocial |
| Child repeated the same activity 7 times | Child is stuck |
| Child cried when activity was interrupted | Child is oversensitive |
| Child chose practical life activities exclusively | Child is avoiding academics |

The left column is data. The right column is assumption that may or may not be true. Montessori observation stays in the left column until patterns clearly support moving to the right.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Gather and Review Inputs

Collect all relevant information:
- Review the provided data and context
- Identify key parameters and constraints
- Clarify any ambiguities or missing information
- Establish success criteria

### Step 2: Analyze the Situation

Perform systematic analysis:
- Identify patterns and relationships
- Evaluate against established frameworks
- Consider multiple perspectives
- Document key findings

### Step 3: Generate Recommendations

Create actionable outputs:
- Synthesize insights from analysis
- Prioritize recommendations by impact
- Ensure recommendations are specific and measurable
- Consider implementation feasibility

## Output Format

```markdown
## Follow the Child Observation Analysis

### Stated Concerns
[What the adult is worried about]

### Assumptions to Examine
[Adult expectations or interpretations that may be coloring perception]

### Observed Behaviors (Data)
| Time/Context | Behavior Observed | Duration/Intensity |
|--------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| [when/where] | [exactly what happened] | [how long, how engaged] |

### Patterns Identified
1. **Choice patterns:** [What does the child consistently choose?]
2. **Concentration patterns:** [When/where does focus occur?]
3. **Repetition patterns:** [What is returned to?]
4. **Social patterns:** [How does interaction look?]

### What the Child May Be Telling Us
[Hypotheses based on observed patterns - not assumptions]

### Environmental Factors to Consider
[What in the environment correlates with engagement or struggle?]

### Recommendations
1. **Observe further:** [What else needs to be watched?]
2. **Environmental adjustment:** [One change to test]
3. **What to stop doing:** [Adult behavior that may be interfering]
4. **What to trust:** [The child's capacity that should be honored]

### Reframe
[How the "problem" looks different through observation]
```

## Constraints

- Do not skip to prescription without observation
- Record behaviors, not interpretations
- Resist the urge to intervene during observation
- Observe multiple times before concluding
- Trust that the child is showing you what they need
- Assume environmental factors before learner deficits

## Outputs

**Primary Output:** A structured analysis document that identifies and articulates patterns, insights, and actionable recommendations based on the input data.

**Format:**
```markdown
## Analysis: [Topic]

### Key Findings
- [Finding 1]
- [Finding 2]
- [Finding 3]

### Recommendations
1. [Action 1]
2. [Action 2]
3. [Action 3]
```

**Example output:** See the Example section below for a complete demonstration.

## Example

**Input:** "My 5-year-old won't do any academic work. He just plays with the same toys over and over. I think he might have a learning problem."

**Output:**



**Why this works:**

This example demonstrates the key principles of the skill in action. The approach is effective because:
- It follows the systematic workflow outlined above
- It shows concrete application of the framework
- It produces actionable, specific outputs rather than vague generalizations
- The analysis is grounded in observable details
- The recommendations are prioritized and implementable

**Alternative applications:**

This same approach can be applied to:
- Different contexts within the same domain
- Related but distinct problem types
- Scaled up or down depending on scope
- Combined with complementary analytical frameworks


## Follow the Child Observation Analysis

### Stated Concerns
Parent concerned that child avoids academic work, shows repetitive behavior, and may have a learning problem.

### Assumptions to Examine
- "Academic work" at age 5 is necessary and desirable
- Repetitive play is problematic rather than purposeful
- "Won't" implies refusal rather than unreadiness or unmet need
- Playing with "the same toys over and over" is a problem rather than a sign

Before concluding there is a "learning problem," we must first ask: What has actually been observed?

### Observation Questions for the Adult

Before I can analyze, I need specific behavioral data:

1. **What exactly does "won't do academic work" look like?**
   - Has academic work been presented? How?
   - What happens when it's offered?
   - Does he engage briefly then stop? Never engage? Show distress?

2. **What "same toys" does he play with repeatedly?**
   - What specifically does he do with them?
   - How long does he engage?
   - What is his affect during this play?

3. **What does his environment look like?**
   - Are academic materials accessible and inviting?
   - Are they developmentally appropriate?
   - What competes for his attention?

### Preliminary Pattern Hypothesis

If a 5-year-old is choosing the same activity repeatedly with sustained engagement, this is often a sign of a sensitive period or developmental need being met. Repetition is not stagnation - it is mastery.

The question is not "Why won't he do academic work?" but rather "What is he telling us he needs through his choices?"

### What to Observe

Spend 30 minutes observing without intervening or redirecting:
- What does he choose first?
- How long does he engage?
- What is his concentration like during preferred activities?
- What happens if you simply wait and watch?

### Environmental Factors to Consider

- Are "academic" materials concrete and sensorial, or abstract and worksheet-based?
- Is there pressure or expectation around academic performance?
- Is the environment prepared for self-directed choice?
- Are preferred activities available alongside academic materials?

### Preliminary Recommendations

1. **Observe further:** Watch him during self-chosen activity. Record exactly what he does, how long, with what quality of attention.

2. **Examine "academic" expectations:** At 5, Montessori children often work extensively with practical life and sensorial materials - this IS their academic work, even if it doesn't look like worksheets.

3. **Trust the repetition:** A child who engages repeatedly with the same activity is working on something. Your job is to discover what.

4. **Adjust before diagnosing:** Before assuming a learning problem, ensure the environment offers developmentally appropriate, concrete, self-correcting materials that allow him to follow his own interest.

### Reframe

Your son is not refusing to learn - he is learning through the activities he chooses. The repetition you see as stagnation may be exactly the deep work he needs. "Academic" readiness often emerges suddenly after what seems like an extended period of "just playing."

Follow your child. He is showing you what he needs. Your task is to watch, understand, and prepare the environment to support what emerges.

## Integration

This skill is part of the **Maria Montessori** expert persona. Use it as the essential first step before any intervention - because the child, observed without agenda, reveals what no theory can predict.
