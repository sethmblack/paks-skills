# Grace Before Effort

Reframe "try harder" advice by identifying enabling conditions (grace) required before willpower can succeed, based on Augustine's insight that the will must be enabled before it can act rightly.

---

## When to Use

- Change initiatives have failed despite good intentions
- "We've tried everything" or "People won't change"
- Training programs that don't stick
- Willpower-based approaches keep failing
- Individual or team cannot do what they know they should do
- New Year's resolutions or commitments repeatedly fail
- Someone says "Why can't I/we just do it?"
- Gap between knowing and doing persists

---

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| desired_change | Yes | The behavior, practice, or transformation that is failing |
| previous_attempts | No | What has been tried and how it failed |
| current_conditions | No | The environment, resources, and support currently present |
| stated_obstacles | No | What is blamed for the failure |

## Augustine's Grace Framework

Augustine's controversy with Pelagius centered on a fundamental question: Can humans change themselves through effort alone, or must they first be enabled?

### Pelagius vs. Augustine

| Pelagius | Augustine |
|----------|-----------|
| Human will is sufficient to do good | The will is wounded and requires healing first |
| Grace = external help (teaching, example) | Grace = internal transformation of the will |
| "Just try harder" is valid advice | Effort without enablement fails |
| Change is a matter of choice | Choice requires capacity; capacity requires grace |

**Augustine's Key Insight:** "Give what you command, and command what you will."

Before commanding action, provide the capacity for action. The will must be enabled before it can succeed.

### Types of Grace (as Enabling Conditions)

| Type | Meaning | Organizational Analog |
|------|---------|----------------------|
| **Prevenient Grace** | Goes before; enables the will to even want the good | Awareness, motivation, vision that makes change desirable |
| **Cooperating Grace** | Works alongside the will | Support, resources, accountability, environment that sustains effort |
| **Sufficient Grace** | Would work if not resisted | Training, tools, permission that could enable change |
| **Efficacious Grace** | Actually produces the effect | The combination that actually works for this person/context |
| **Perseverance** | Sustains over time | Ongoing support that maintains change through setbacks |

---

## The Analysis Process

### Step 1: Acknowledge the Wounded Will

"The mind commands itself and meets resistance."

Before diagnosing what's missing, acknowledge the reality:
- Knowing what to do is not the same as doing it
- Intention does not automatically produce action
- The gap between knowing and doing is universal, not a character flaw
- Blaming the individual for systemic failures is Pelagian

**Key Question:** "Given that we know what to do and cannot do it, what is preventing the will from acting?"

### Step 2: Identify Missing Prevenient Grace

What must come *before* effort can succeed?

**Prevenient conditions often missing:**
- **Genuine motivation:** Do they actually want this, or is it imposed?
- **Vision of the good:** Can they see what success looks like?
- **Hope:** Do they believe change is possible?
- **Permission:** Is the change actually allowed in the culture?
- **Awareness:** Do they fully understand what must change?

**Signs prevenient grace is missing:**
- Change is demanded but not desired
- Goals are abstract, not vivid
- Past failures have produced hopelessness
- Attempting change would violate unspoken norms

**Key Question:** "What must be true before the person/team would even *want* to make this change?"

### Step 3: Identify Missing Cooperating Grace

What ongoing support is needed to sustain effort?

**Cooperating conditions often missing:**
- **Resources:** Time, money, tools, authority
- **Environment:** Physical or social conditions that make change easier
- **Accountability:** Supportive check-ins (not punishment-oriented)
- **Community:** Others making the same change
- **Reduced friction:** Removal of obstacles
- **Positive feedback:** Recognition of progress

**Signs cooperating grace is missing:**
- Initial enthusiasm fades without result
- Change happens briefly then relapses
- Individual effort exhausts without institutional support
- The environment actively resists the new behavior

**Key Question:** "What ongoing support would make this change sustainable rather than exhausting?"

### Step 4: Diagnose Why Sufficient Grace Is Not Efficacious

Sometimes the resources exist but don't produce change. Why?

**Common gaps:**
- Training provided but environment doesn't allow application
- Tools available but not integrated into workflow
- Permission granted but culture punishes the behavior
- Support offered but not in the form the person can receive

**The efficacy test:** Grace is efficacious when it *actually works* for this specific person/context, not when it *should* work in theory.

**Key Question:** "Why hasn't what we've already provided produced the change?"

### Step 5: Design for Perseverance

Change is not an event but a sustained state. What maintains it?

**Perseverance requires:**
- **Expectation of setbacks:** Relapse is normal, not failure
- **Recovery protocols:** How to resume after falling off
- **Long-term support:** Not just launch support but ongoing maintenance
- **Integration into identity:** Change becomes who they are, not what they do
- **Celebration of progress:** Recognition that sustains motivation

**Signs perseverance support is missing:**
- Changes last 2-6 weeks then revert
- Single failures are treated as total failure
- Support disappears after initial push
- Success is defined as instant perfection

**Key Question:** "What would enable this change to persist through setbacks over months and years?"

## Constraints

- **Do not skip to effort.** The whole point is that effort without enablement fails
- **Do not blame the individual.** If systemic conditions prevent change, blaming willpower is unjust
- **Be specific about grace needed.** "More support" is not actionable; name the specific enabling conditions
- **Distinguish types of grace.** What comes before, during, and for persistence are different
- **Accept that some grace is not yours to give.** You may only be able to identify what's needed, not provide it

## Example

**Input:** "We've rolled out three different agile transformations in five years. Each time, teams get excited, go through training, try it for 3-4 months, then slowly revert to waterfall. Leadership keeps asking why people can't just follow the process they were trained on."

**Output:**

## Grace Before Effort Analysis

### The Desired Change
Sustained adoption of agile practices across development teams

### The Wounded Will
Three transformation attempts have failed. Teams receive training, attempt new practices, and revert within 3-4 months. Leadership frames this as a willpower problem ("why can't people just follow the process"). The pattern of repeated failure suggests the will is not the problem - the enabling conditions are.

### Prevenient Grace Needed (Before Effort)

| Condition | Current State | What's Needed |
|-----------|--------------|---------------|
| Motivation | Imposed, not desired | Teams must see why agile serves *their* interests, not just leadership's mandate |
| Vision | Abstract ("be agile") | Concrete vision of what daily work looks like after change |
| Hope | Diminished (3 failures) | Acknowledgment of past failures and what will be different this time |
| Permission | Ambiguous | If agile means failing fast, is failure actually permitted? If agile means empowered teams, do teams have authority? |

**Critical Prevenient Gap:** Teams may be trained in agile but not permitted to actually practice it. Does the organization tolerate the failures and authority shifts agile requires? If not, training without permission is setting people up to fail.

### Cooperating Grace Needed (During Effort)

| Support Type | Current State | What's Needed |
|--------------|--------------|---------------|
| Resources | Training provided | Ongoing coaching, not just initial training |
| Environment | Hostile (waterfall infrastructure) | CI/CD, iterative funding, flexible roadmaps |
| Accountability | Leadership pressure | Supportive check-ins that help teams problem-solve |
| Community | Isolated teams | Cross-team agile community of practice |
| Time | Compressed expectations | Realistic timeline for transformation (18+ months, not 3-4) |

**Critical Cooperating Gap:** Training is provided (sufficient grace) but ongoing coaching is absent. The environment remains structured for waterfall (annual budgets, fixed scope contracts, detailed upfront requirements). Teams are trained to behave one way in an environment that demands another.

### Why Current Grace Is Not Efficacious
Training (sufficient grace) is provided, but it's not efficacious because:
1. **Environment contradicts training:** Teams are trained in iterative delivery but measured on fixed scope/date
2. **Permission is not real:** Agile requires authority and failure tolerance that culture doesn't provide
3. **Support ends at training:** No ongoing coaching to help teams navigate real challenges
4. **Timeline is unrealistic:** 3-4 months is not enough; reversion begins just as hard changes are required

### Perseverance Design

| Element | Current | Needed |
|---------|---------|--------|
| Setback expectation | Perfectionist (reversion = failure) | Explicit: "We expect struggles in months 3-6; here's how we'll support you" |
| Recovery protocol | Absent (teams left to fail) | Regular retrospectives with leadership support for obstacle removal |
| Long-term support | Absent after training | 18-month transformation timeline with coaching throughout |

### Recommended Enabling Conditions

**Before demanding agile adoption:**

1. **Prevenient:** Align incentives so agile serves teams, not just leadership. Show what's in it for them.

2. **Prevenient:** Acknowledge the three previous failures. Explain what will be different. Restore hope.

3. **Prevenient:** Grant real permission. If agile requires failing fast, ensure failure is actually safe. If agile requires team authority, actually grant authority.

4. **Cooperating:** Transform the environment. Fixed-scope contracts, annual budgets, and detailed upfront requirements make agile impossible. Change the infrastructure before demanding the behavior.

5. **Cooperating:** Provide ongoing coaching, not just training. Training tells you what to do; coaching helps you do it when it's hard.

6. **Perseverance:** Set realistic expectations. Plan for 18+ months, not 3-4. Build in support for the difficult middle period when enthusiasm fades but habits aren't formed.

### What Not to Do

- **Do not roll out training #4 without changing conditions.** This is Pelagian: commanding without giving.
- **Do not blame teams for reverting.** They reverted because the environment demanded waterfall and punished agile.
- **Do not expect faster results.** The three failures have created learned helplessness. Recovery takes longer.
- **Do not assume training is sufficient.** Training transfers knowledge; transformation requires ongoing support.

**Augustine's Wisdom:** "Give what you command, and command what you will."

The organization has been commanding agile without giving the conditions for agile to succeed. Before the next transformation attempt, ask: "What must we provide so that our teams *can* do what we're asking?" Willpower is not the problem. Grace is.

## Integration

This skill is part of the **Augustine of Hippo** expert persona. It applies Augustine's theology of grace from his anti-Pelagian writings to practical change management.

For related analysis:
- Use **confessional-analysis** to honestly examine why previous attempts failed
- Use **ordo-amoris-audit** to understand if organizational priorities conflict with the desired change
- Use **two-cities-assessment** to see if the organization serves its transformation mission or its existing comfort
