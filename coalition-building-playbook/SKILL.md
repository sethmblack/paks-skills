# Coalition Building Playbook

Develop strategy for building political coalitions to advance urban transformation projects over multi-year timelines. Based on Amanda Burden's decade-long High Line fight and experience navigating 124 neighborhood rezonings through NYC's approval process - understanding that great plans fail without political support.

---

## Constitutional Constraints

- **Stamina over speed** - Transformative projects take years; plan for marathon, not sprint
- **Listen before proposing** - Community engagement is resource, not obstacle
- **Never compromise non-negotiables** - Know what you can trade and what you cannot
- **Respect opposition** - Opponents often have legitimate concerns; address them, don't dismiss them

---

## When to Use

- Major project facing community or political opposition
- Need to build support across multiple stakeholder groups
- Navigating complex approval process (community boards, councils, commissions)
- Timing decisions for controversial initiatives
- Identifying where to compromise and where to hold firm
- Sustaining advocacy over multi-year timeline

## Don't Use When

- Project is technical only, no political dimension
- Support already exists and approval is routine
- User needs design or planning help rather than political strategy
- Situation requires immediate crisis response, not long-term coalition

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| project_description | Yes | What is being proposed and why it matters |
| stakeholder_landscape | Yes | Who supports, opposes, is undecided; why |
| approval_requirements | Yes | What approvals needed; from whom; timeline |
| concerns_objections | Recommended | Specific concerns from opponents |
| available_trade-offs | Recommended | What can be modified; what is non-negotiable |
| timeline_constraints | Recommended | Deadlines, elections, external factors |
| resources | Optional | Budget, staff, allies available for campaign |

## The High Line Lesson

The High Line took ten years from idea to opening. At every stage, there were people who wanted to tear it down. The coalition won because they:

1. **Showed up to every meeting** - Consistent presence builds credibility
2. **Answered every question** - Respect opponents by taking their concerns seriously
3. **Addressed every concern** - Modified design to address legitimate issues
4. **Built unexpected alliances** - Property owners became supporters when they saw value
5. **Never stopped making the case** - Persistent advocacy over years, not months
6. **Demonstrated success incrementally** - Early victories built momentum for later battles

**The Burden Principle:** You cannot charm your way through a community board meeting. You have to earn support through sustained engagement, genuine responsiveness, and visible commitment to the long haul.

## Coalition Building Workflow

### Step 1: Stakeholder Mapping

Identify all parties with interest in the project:

| Stakeholder | Position | Interest | Influence | Engagement Priority |
|-------------|----------|----------|-----------|---------------------|
| [Name/Group] | Support/Oppose/Undecided | [What they care about] | High/Medium/Low | [Priority level] |

**Stakeholder Categories:**

**Supporters (to mobilize):**
- Project beneficiaries
- Allied organizations
- Political champions
- Business interests aligned with project

**Opponents (to address):**
- Directly affected parties with concerns
- Ideological opposition
- Competing interests
- Status quo beneficiaries

**Undecided (to persuade):**
- Community members not yet engaged
- Political actors waiting to see which way wind blows
- Potential allies who don't yet see connection to their interests

**Decision-makers (to influence):**
- Elected officials with approval authority
- Agency heads
- Commission/board members
- Staff with recommendation authority

### Step 2: Opposition Analysis

Understand why opponents oppose:

| Opponent | Stated Concern | Underlying Interest | Addressable? | Response Strategy |
|----------|----------------|---------------------|--------------|-------------------|
| [Name/Group] | [What they say] | [What they really care about] | Yes/No/Partially | [Approach] |

**Concern Categories:**

1. **Legitimate and addressable** - Modify project to address
2. **Legitimate but not addressable** - Acknowledge trade-off honestly
3. **Misinformed** - Provide accurate information
4. **Ideological** - Unlikely to persuade; focus on neutralizing
5. **Self-interested** - May be addressable through direct negotiation

**Key Question:** Is the opposition about this specific project, or about something deeper that this project triggers?

### Step 3: Coalition Strategy

Design the support-building campaign:

**Coalition Architecture:**
| Ring | Who | Role | Engagement |
|------|-----|------|------------|
| Core | Project team, committed allies | Lead advocacy; show up to every meeting | Constant coordination |
| Champions | Political sponsors, visible supporters | Provide credibility; open doors | Regular briefings |
| Base | Organizations and individuals who support | Show up when asked; provide numbers | Mobilize for key moments |
| Persuadable | Undecided parties | Move to support through engagement | Targeted outreach |
| Neutralizable | Soft opposition | Reduce intensity of opposition | Address concerns; reduce stakes |

**Sequencing:**
1. **Secure core** - Ensure project team is aligned and committed
2. **Recruit champions** - Find political sponsors before going public
3. **Build base** - Engage allied organizations and supportive community members
4. **Address concerns** - Proactive outreach to those with legitimate questions
5. **Go public** - Announce with visible coalition support
6. **Sustain** - Maintain engagement through approval process

### Step 4: Messaging Framework

Develop consistent narrative:

**Core Message:**
| Element | Content |
|---------|---------|
| **The Opportunity** | [What becomes possible] |
| **The Risk of Inaction** | [What happens if we don't act] |
| **The Public Benefit** | [Who benefits and how] |
| **The Response to Concerns** | [How legitimate issues are addressed] |

**Audience-Specific Framing:**

| Audience | Emphasize | De-emphasize | Key Proof Points |
|----------|-----------|--------------|------------------|
| Residents | Quality of life, community benefits | Technical details | [Specific benefits] |
| Business | Economic impact, investment | Process details | [Economic data] |
| Environmentalists | Sustainability, public space | Development aspects | [Green benefits] |
| Fiscal hawks | Revenue, efficiency | Costs without context | [Fiscal impact] |
| Elected officials | Constituent support, legacy | Controversy | [Political benefits] |

**Objection Responses:**
| Objection | Response | Evidence |
|-----------|----------|----------|
| [Common objection 1] | [Counter-argument] | [Supporting evidence] |
| [Common objection 2] | [Counter-argument] | [Supporting evidence] |

### Step 5: Approval Navigation

Map the approval process:

| Stage | Decision-Maker | Timeline | Key Players | Strategy |
|-------|----------------|----------|-------------|----------|
| [Stage 1] | [Who decides] | [When] | [Staff, members] | [Approach] |
| [Stage 2] | [Who decides] | [When] | [Staff, members] | [Approach] |

**For Each Approval Body:**

| Member | Position | Concerns | Approach |
|--------|----------|----------|----------|
| [Name] | Support/Lean Support/Undecided/Lean Oppose/Oppose | [Specific concerns] | [Engagement strategy] |

**Vote Counting:**
- Needed to approve: [X]
- Solid support: [X]
- Lean support: [X]
- Undecided: [X]
- Lean oppose: [X]
- Solid oppose: [X]

**Path to Majority:** [Strategy to get from current count to needed votes]

### Step 6: Long-Term Sustainability

Plan for multi-year campaign:

**Stamina Requirements:**
| Year | Key Activities | Milestones | Risk Factors |
|------|----------------|------------|--------------|
| Year 1 | [Activities] | [What success looks like] | [What could go wrong] |
| Year 2 | [Activities] | [Milestones] | [Risks] |
| Year 3+ | [Activities] | [Milestones] | [Risks] |

**Sustaining Engagement:**
- Regular coalition meetings (monthly minimum)
- Progress updates to supporters (even when slow)
- Visible quick wins to maintain momentum
- Respond rapidly to opposition narratives
- Celebrate milestones publicly

**Avoiding Burnout:**
- Rotate leadership responsibilities
- Pace expectations realistically
- Acknowledge that timeline is years, not months
- Build team depth beyond single champions

## Example Summary

**Input:** "We want to convert an abandoned highway into a linear park, but the neighborhood association is opposed. They fear it will increase property values and displace long-time residents. City Council is split. How do we build support?"

**Output (abbreviated):**

Coalition Strategy: [Highway Park] Linear Park

**Stakeholder Analysis:**
- Supporters: Environmental groups, downtown business association, parks advocates
- Opponents: Neighborhood association (fear displacement), some Council members (responsive to neighborhood)
- Undecided: Most Council members, adjacent neighborhood associations
- Decision-makers: City Council (7 needed out of 13)

**Opposition Response:**
The displacement concern is legitimate. Address it by:
1. Package park with anti-displacement measures (rent stabilization, CLT pilot)
2. Guarantee construction jobs go to local residents (local hire requirements)
3. Ensure programming serves existing community, not just newcomers
4. Create community advisory board with resident majority

**Coalition Strategy:**
1. Lead with anti-displacement measures - show you heard the concern
2. Recruit neighborhood leaders who support (there are some)
3. Demonstrate that opposition leadership doesn't speak for everyone
4. Build unusual coalition: environmentalists + housing advocates + labor
5. Get three Council endorsements before public announcement

**Path to Victory:**
Current count: 4 support, 3 oppose, 6 undecided
Need: 7 votes
Strategy: Win 3 of 6 undecided by addressing displacement directly; show constituent support in their districts

**Timeline:** 18-24 months to approval; 3-5 years to opening

---

## Error Handling

| Situation | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| Opposition is overwhelming | Reassess project scope; consider phasing; may need to build support before advancing |
| Political champion loses election | Cultivate multiple champions; plan for political transitions |
| Community concerns can't be addressed | Acknowledge honestly; explain trade-offs; accept some opposition will remain |
| Timeline extends indefinitely | Set milestones; if not achievable, reassess viability |

---

## Integration

This skill is part of the **Amanda Burden** expert persona. Use it when building political support for urban projects. It pairs well with:
- **rezoning-transformation-design** for the substantive rezoning plan
- **waterfront-reclamation-strategy** for waterfront projects
- **public-space-assessment** for understanding community needs

The skill embodies Burden's core insight: **Great plans that can't be approved are worthless. Show up to every meeting. Answer every question. Never stop making the case.**
