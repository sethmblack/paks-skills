# Defamiliarization

A skill for showing familiar practices from outside perspectives that reveal their absurdity or injustice.

## When to Use

- When practices are so normalized they seem natural or inevitable
- When you want readers to see their own world with fresh eyes
- When the strangeness of something is hidden by familiarity
- When an outside perspective would immediately see what insiders cannot

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| input_data | Yes | The primary data or content to analyze |
| context | No | Additional background or constraints (default: none) |
| output_format | No | Preferred format for results (default: structured markdown) |

## Workflow
### Step 1: Phase 1: Choose the Familiar

Identify practices so normal they've become invisible:
- Commuting (spending hours daily in metal boxes, alone)
- Advertising (paying to be manipulated into wanting things)
- Office work (sitting in artificial light doing abstract tasks)
- Social media (comparing your life to curated fictions)
- Electoral politics (choosing between options selected by others)

The more normal, the better - defamiliarization works on assumptions.

### Step 2: Phase 2: Construct the Outsider

Create a perspective with no context for the familiar:
- A visitor from a society organized differently
- A future historian trying to understand an extinct culture
- A child asking questions adults have stopped asking
- A rational being encountering irrationality

The outsider must be genuinely confused, not mockingly so.

### Step 3: Phase 3: Describe Without Assumptions

Have the outsider describe what they see without the concepts that make it normal:
- Not "going to work" but "traveling to a building to perform tasks that could be done anywhere"
- Not "paying taxes" but "surrendering a portion of all they produce to an organization that may use it to kill people in other lands"
- Not "getting married" but "seeking state permission to live together"

Remove the euphemisms and packaging.

### Step 4: Phase 4: Attempt to Explain

The outsider tries to understand:
- Offers hypotheses that are wrong but reasonable
- Asks questions that have no good answers
- Compares to how their society handles the same need
- Expresses confusion that accumulates into critique

### Step 5: Phase 5: Report Without Judgment

The outsider's conclusion should be descriptive, not preachy:
- "And so it seems they..." (factual summary of absurdity)
- Allow readers to supply the judgment themselves
- The more neutral the tone, the more devastating the effect

## Output Format

A defamiliarization piece including:
1. The familiar practice being examined
2. The outsider perspective and their frame
3. The description stripped of normalizing language
4. The attempted explanations and their failures
5. The neutral conclusion that indicts

## Constraints

- The outsider must be genuinely trying to understand, not smugly mocking
- The description must be accurate - exaggeration weakens the effect
- Avoid explicit judgment - let the description do the work
- Works best with genuinely absurd or unjust practices, not mere differences
- Consider that some practices withstand defamiliarization - they may actually make sense

## Outputs

**Primary Output:** A structured analysis document that identifies and articulates patterns, insights, and actionable recommendations based on the input data.

**Format:**
```markdown
## Analysis: [Topic]

### Key Findings
- [Finding 1]
- [Finding 2]
- [Finding 3]

### Recommendations
1. [Action 1]
2. [Action 2]
3. [Action 3]
```

**Example output:** See the Example section below for a complete demonstration.

## Additional Notes

**Best practices:**
- Use this skill when the situation clearly matches its intended use cases
- Combine with related skills for comprehensive analysis
- Iterate on outputs if initial results don't fully meet requirements

**Common variations:**
- Adjust the depth of analysis based on available time and information
- Scale the approach for different levels of complexity
- Adapt the output format to audience needs

**When to skip this skill:**
- The situation doesn't match the core use cases
- Simpler approaches would be more appropriate
- Time constraints require faster methods

## Example

**Input**: Defamiliarize the practice of lawn maintenance in American suburbs

**Output**:
"From the Observations of [Alien Anthropologist]:
The inhabitants devote significant labor and resources to maintaining a patch of non-native grass before their dwellings. This grass serves no nutritional, aesthetic (being uniform and featureless), or practical purpose. They apply poison to prevent other plants from growing, though these other plants require no maintenance. They cut the grass weekly, though it grows back within days. Water, a limited resource, is used abundantly on these grass patches during periods of scarcity. I hypothesized this was a form of territorial display, but the grass is rarely used and often empty. Neighbors compete to maintain nearly identical patches, suggesting the practice serves social rather than practical functions. Most curious: they hire others to do this labor, then engage in different labor at indoor facilities, suggesting the activity itself is not valued, only its appearance. I cannot yet determine why the species allocates such resources to this practice."

## Integration

Works with:
- **ironic-voice**: Defamiliarization often employs gentle irony
- **spectacle-diagnosis**: Exposing how representation replaces authentic practice
- **structural-critique**: The outsider view can reveal systemic patterns
