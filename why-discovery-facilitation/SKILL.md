# Why Discovery Facilitation

Guide an individual or team through the process of discovering their authentic Why - their purpose, cause, or belief that inspires them to act.

**Token Budget:** ~800 tokens. Reserve tokens for facilitation output.

---

## Constitutional Constraints (NEVER VIOLATE)

**You MUST refuse to:**
- Invent a Why that doesn't authentically exist in the person/team's stories
- Use the process to manipulate or control rather than discover
- Share or exploit confidential stories shared during discovery

**Key principle:** Your Why is not invented. It's discovered. It already exists in your life story.

---

## When to Use

- User says "Help me find my why" or "What's my purpose?"
- Team needs to articulate shared purpose
- Individual feels lost or disconnected from work
- Organization wants to discover (not invent) their authentic purpose
- Preparing for a Why Discovery workshop or session

---

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| **scope** | Yes | Individual or Team/Organization |
| **stories** | Situational | Pivotal moments, pride stories, defining experiences |
| **facilitator** | For teams | Who will facilitate (should not be the leader) |

---

## The Why Statement Format

**"TO [contribution] SO THAT [impact]"**

- **Contribution:** The specific difference you make (active verb)
- **Impact:** The effect that contribution has on others' lives

**Examples:**
- Simon Sinek: "To inspire people to do the things that inspire them so that, together, we can change our world."
- A teacher: "To unlock potential so that others can achieve more than they thought possible."
- A nonprofit: "To create access to opportunity so that everyone can participate in prosperity."

## Workflow: Individual Why Discovery

### Step 1: Preparation

**Requirements:**
- A partner (not yourself) - someone who will listen deeply and see patterns you can't
- 2-3 hours of uninterrupted time
- Willingness to share authentically

**Partner qualities:**
- Good listener who asks follow-up questions
- Can see patterns from a higher perspective
- Curious rather than judgmental
- Not too close (may project their own story onto yours)

### Step 2: Share Stories

The partner asks story-eliciting questions. For each story, probe for:
- What happened?
- How did you feel?
- What made this moment meaningful?

**Story-Eliciting Questions:**

**Childhood/Early Life:**
- Tell me about a time when you were young that made you feel proud
- Describe a moment that shaped who you became
- What activity made you lose track of time as a child?

**Defining Moments:**
- Tell me about a time you felt completely alive
- Describe your proudest professional moment
- What's a time you felt you made a real difference?
- When have you felt most yourself?

**Contribution:**
- Tell me about a time you helped someone and it felt deeply meaningful
- Describe a moment when you knew you were doing what you were meant to do
- What accomplishment would you want to be remembered for?

**The partner's job:** Listen for recurring themes, emotions, and patterns - not to solve problems.

### Step 3: Identify Themes

After 5-7 stories, the partner reflects back:

- "I notice that in several stories, you mentioned..."
- "A pattern I see is..."
- "You seem to light up when you talk about..."

**Common theme categories:**
- Type of impact (teaching, building, connecting, creating)
- Emotions (freedom, safety, growth, belonging)
- Beneficiaries (individuals, teams, underdogs, communities)
- Methods (through listening, through challenge, through possibility)

### Step 4: Draft the Why

Using the themes, construct a Why statement:

**Format:** "TO [contribution] SO THAT [impact]"

**Draft criteria:**
- Contribution is specific and action-oriented
- Impact focuses on the benefit to others
- Statement is personal and emotional, not corporate
- Could apply to any context (work, home, volunteer)

**Iteration prompts:**
- Does this resonate? Feel true?
- Would you be proud to share this with anyone?
- Does this help explain why you make the choices you make?

### Step 5: Refine Until Resonant

The statement isn't done until it:
- Feels emotionally true (goosebumps, tears, deep recognition)
- Applies across life contexts
- Explains past choices and guides future ones
- You would share it proudly

## Workflow: Team/Organization Why Discovery

### Key Differences from Individual

| Aspect | Individual | Team |
|--------|------------|------|
| Stories come from | One person's life | Multiple members' experiences with the organization |
| Facilitator | Partner (anyone) | External or non-leader |
| Stories asked | Life-defining moments | Times proud to work here |
| Output | Personal Why | Shared organizational Why |

### Step 1: Preparation

**Requirements:**
- Facilitator who is NOT the team leader
- Representative sample of team (8-20 people ideal)
- 4-6 hours of dedicated time
- Confidentiality commitment

**Critical:** Leader must not facilitate. Their presence can constrain honesty. Leader can participate as equal contributor.

### Step 2: Share Stories

Facilitator prompts:
- "Tell me about a specific time you were proud to work here."
- "Describe a moment when you thought, 'This is why I do this.'"
- "Share a time when you saw this organization at its best."

**For each story, capture:**
- The specific event
- Who was involved
- What made it meaningful
- How it felt

### Step 3: Identify Themes

Group synthesizes themes across all stories:
- What contribution keeps appearing?
- What impact keeps being described?
- What words or feelings recur?

**Process:**
- Write themes on board
- Group votes on most resonant
- Discuss what's missing

### Step 4: Draft the Why

As a group, construct:

**"TO [contribution] SO THAT [impact]"**

Multiple iterations until majority resonates.

### Step 5: Verify with Broader Team

The draft Why should be tested with people who weren't in the room:
- Does it feel true to them?
- Can they see themselves in it?
- Would they be proud to share it?

## Workflow

### Step 1: Gather and Review Inputs

Collect all relevant information:
- Review the provided data and context
- Identify key parameters and constraints
- Clarify any ambiguities or missing information
- Establish success criteria

### Step 2: Analyze the Situation

Perform systematic analysis:
- Identify patterns and relationships
- Evaluate against established frameworks
- Consider multiple perspectives
- Document key findings

### Step 3: Generate Recommendations

Create actionable outputs:
- Synthesize insights from analysis
- Prioritize recommendations by impact
- Ensure recommendations are specific and measurable
- Consider implementation feasibility

## Error Handling

| Situation | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| Stories are surface-level | Ask "Why did that matter to you?" and "How did that feel?" |
| Person can't think of stories | Try: "Tell me about someone who influenced you" or "When did you feel most yourself?" |
| Why sounds corporate | Push for emotion: "Forget how it sounds. What's actually true?" |
| Team has no shared experience | May not have shared Why; consider whether team is truly a tribe |
| Leader wants to dominate | Remind: Why comes from stories, not from the leader's vision |

## Outputs

**Primary Output:** A structured analysis document that identifies and articulates patterns, insights, and actionable recommendations based on the input data.

**Format:**
```markdown
## Analysis: [Topic]

### Key Findings
- [Finding 1]
- [Finding 2]
- [Finding 3]

### Recommendations
1. [Action 1]
2. [Action 2]
3. [Action 3]
```

**Example output:** See the Example section below for a complete demonstration.

## Constraints

- Do not use this analysis as the sole basis for critical decisions
- Do not apply this framework to situations outside its intended scope
- Acknowledge that analysis is based on available data, which may be incomplete
- Honor the complexity of real-world situations that resist simple categorization
- Present findings with appropriate confidence levels
- Recognize the limits of the methodology

## Example

**Input:**
"I want to find my personal why. I'm a software engineer who used to teach, and I volunteer with kids coding programs."

**Output:**



**Why this works:**

This example demonstrates the key principles of the skill in action. The approach is effective because:
- It follows the systematic workflow outlined above
- It shows concrete application of the framework
- It produces actionable, specific outputs rather than vague generalizations
- The analysis is grounded in observable details
- The recommendations are prioritized and implementable

**Alternative applications:**

This same approach can be applied to:
- Different contexts within the same domain
- Related but distinct problem types
- Scaled up or down depending on scope
- Combined with complementary analytical frameworks


## Why Discovery Facilitation

### Scope
Individual

### Story-Eliciting Questions

To discover your Why, I need to hear your stories. Let's explore:

1. **Teaching:** Tell me about a specific moment as a teacher when you felt you made a real difference.

2. **Coding with Kids:** Describe a time in your volunteer work that moved you or made you proud.

3. **Software Engineering:** Share a professional moment when you thought "This is why I do this."

4. **Defining Moment:** What's a time in your life - any context - when you felt completely alive?

### Based on Your Description, Potential Themes to Explore

Given your path (teaching → engineering → volunteering with kids), I see potential patterns:
- **Unlocking:** Helping others see what's possible
- **Teaching:** Sharing knowledge and capability
- **Youth/Potential:** Focus on those just starting
- **Technology as empowerment:** Code as a tool for opportunity

### Questions to Probe

- In both teaching and volunteer work, what moment specifically made you think "Yes"?
- Why kids specifically? What is it about that age that calls to you?
- When have you helped someone "get it" and what did that feel like?

### Draft Why Direction

Based on your description (pending real stories), a potential draft:

**"TO unlock possibility through understanding SO THAT the next generation can build futures they imagine."**

This is only a starting point. Your real Why will come from your stories, not my inference. When you share specific moments, the themes will reveal themselves.

### Next Step

Share 3-5 specific stories with someone who will listen. Look for patterns. The Why will emerge.

## Integration

This skill is derived from Simon Sinek and team's work in *Find Your Why*. When invoked by the simon-sinek expert, apply Sinek's voice: curious, patient, focused on discovery rather than invention.
