# Landscape Integration Assessment

Evaluate how well a design integrates with its site and context—treating buildings as artificial topographies that should flow with landscape rather than objects placed upon it. Based on Zaha Hadid's approach: "The building is not an object placed on a site. It is a new landscape itself—the floors rising into walls, walls curving into ceilings, the whole structure flowing like terrain."

---

## When to Use

- Evaluating whether a design belongs to its site or just sits on it
- Designing buildings that should become part of their landscape
- Assessing site integration of existing or proposed projects
- Creating connections between interior and exterior
- Developing masterplans where buildings and landscape are one system
- Critiquing designs that feel disconnected from their context

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| design | Yes | The building or project to evaluate |
| site_description | Yes | Physical characteristics of the site |
| context | No | Surrounding buildings, landscape, urban fabric |
| climate | No | Weather, sun, wind conditions |
| intended_relationship | No | How the design should relate to its context |

## The Integration Principle

### Objects vs. Landscapes

| Object on Site | Landscape Integration |
|----------------|----------------------|
| Building sits on the ground | Building emerges from the ground |
| Clear boundary between inside and outside | Inside and outside flow into each other |
| Landscape stops at the building edge | Landscape continues through the building |
| Site is backdrop | Site and building are one composition |
| You enter the building | You inhabit the landform |

### Hadid's Landscape Approach

At the Heydar Aliyev Center:
> "The design establishes a continuous, fluid relationship between its surrounding plaza and the building's interior. The plaza, as the ground surface... rises to envelop an equally public interior space."

At Guangzhou Opera House:
> "Like pebbles in a stream smoothed by erosion, the Guangzhou Opera House sits in perfect harmony with its riverside location."

The building does not occupy the landscape—it *becomes* landscape.

## Assessment Process

### Step 1: Analyze Site as Force Field

Map the site's characteristics as forces that could shape form:

**Site Force Analysis:**

| Force | Direction/Character | Strength | Design Response? |
|-------|---------------------|----------|------------------|
| Topography | Slopes [direction], rises [amount] | [Strong/Moderate/Weak] | [How design responds] |
| Solar path | From [direction] to [direction] | [Strong sun/Moderate/Diffuse] | [How design responds] |
| Wind | Prevailing from [direction] | [Strong/Moderate/Light] | [How design responds] |
| Views | Toward [features] | [Significant/Moderate/None] | [How design responds] |
| Water | [Rivers, coast, drainage] | [Present/Absent] | [How design responds] |
| Vegetation | [Trees, planting patterns] | [Dense/Sparse/None] | [How design responds] |
| Urban fabric | [Streets, buildings, paths] | [Dense/Moderate/Rural] | [How design responds] |

### Step 2: Evaluate Ground Plane Continuity

How does the ground relate to the building?

**Ground Plane Assessment:**

| Criterion | Current State | Integration Score | Notes |
|-----------|---------------|-------------------|-------|
| Entry transition | [Abrupt step / Gradual rise / Seamless flow] | [1-10] | [Details] |
| Floor-to-ground relationship | [Elevated / At grade / Below grade / Varies] | [1-10] | [Details] |
| Landscape continuation | [Stops at edge / Enters building / Flows through] | [1-10] | [Details] |
| Material continuity | [Different materials / Related / Same] | [1-10] | [Details] |

**Ground Plane Score:** [Average of above] / 10

### Step 3: Assess Boundary Dissolution

How porous is the edge between inside and outside?

**Boundary Assessment:**

| Boundary Type | Present? | Integration Approach |
|---------------|----------|---------------------|
| Visual permeability | [None / Partial / Full] | [How achieved] |
| Physical flow | [Blocked / Controlled / Open] | [How achieved] |
| Environmental connection | [Sealed / Mediated / Open] | [How achieved] |
| Material continuity | [Discontinuous / Related / Continuous] | [How achieved] |

**Boundary Dissolution Score:** [1-10]

### Step 4: Evaluate Topographic Response

Does the building respond to landform or ignore it?

**Topographic Assessment:**

| Criterion | Assessment | Score |
|-----------|------------|-------|
| Follows natural contours | [Ignores / Acknowledges / Embraces] | [1-10] |
| Creates artificial topography | [Flat / Minor variation / Significant landform] | [1-10] |
| Roofscape as landscape | [Flat/ignored / Accessible / Continuous with site] | [1-10] |
| Section relates to ground | [Generic / Responds to grades / Shaped by terrain] | [1-10] |

**Topographic Score:** [Average] / 10

### Step 5: Assess Contextual Resonance

Does the building relate to its surroundings?

**Context Assessment:**

| Aspect | Relationship | Quality |
|--------|--------------|---------|
| Scale | [Ignores context / Respects / Enhances] | [1-10] |
| Orientation | [Arbitrary / Aligned / Responsive] | [1-10] |
| Material | [Unrelated / Sympathetic / Integrated] | [1-10] |
| Form language | [Alien / Complementary / Evolved from site] | [1-10] |

**Context Score:** [Average] / 10

### Step 6: Calculate Overall Integration

**Integration Matrix:**

| Dimension | Score | Weight | Weighted |
|-----------|-------|--------|----------|
| Ground Plane | [X/10] | 25% | [X * 0.25] |
| Boundary Dissolution | [X/10] | 20% | [X * 0.20] |
| Topographic Response | [X/10] | 25% | [X * 0.25] |
| Contextual Resonance | [X/10] | 20% | [X * 0.20] |
| Climate Response | [X/10] | 10% | [X * 0.10] |

**Total Integration Score:** [Sum] / 10

**Integration Level:**
- 9-10: Exemplary—building and site are one
- 7-8: Strong—meaningful site relationship
- 5-6: Moderate—some integration, some missed opportunities
- 3-4: Weak—building mostly ignores site
- 1-2: Object—building is placed on site with no integration

## Constraints

- Not all sites have strong forces to respond to; some urban sites are constrained
- Integration does not mean imitation; a building can be distinct and still integrated
- Climate and safety may require boundaries between inside and outside
- Historic contexts may have preservation constraints
- The goal is thoughtful relationship, not forced formal connection

---

## Error Handling

| Situation | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| Site appears to have no character | Look deeper; every site has forces (sun, wind, views, edges) |
| Design is already built | Assess what was achieved; suggest interventions if possible |
| Client does not value integration | Articulate the benefits: energy, experience, value |
| Site is entirely urban/artificial | Urban fabric is context; streets, buildings, infrastructure are forces |
| Context is hostile | Integration can include screening, buffering—still a response |

**Example output:** See the Example section below for a complete demonstration.

## Example

**Input:** "We've designed a new visitor center for a national park. It's a glass-and-steel pavilion on a flat concrete platform, elevated above the meadow on columns. The design is meant to have 'minimal impact' on the landscape. How does it score on landscape integration?"

**Output:**

## Landscape Integration Assessment: National Park Visitor Center

### Site Overview

**Location:** Meadow within national park, surrounded by forest
**Key characteristics:** Gently undulating meadow; views to mountain peaks; temperate climate with distinct seasons; ecological sensitivity; visitors seeking nature immersion

### Site Force Analysis

| Force | Character | Design Response |
|-------|-----------|-----------------|
| Topography | Gentle meadow undulations | **Ignored**—platform is flat, elevated above contours |
| Views | Dramatic mountain panorama | **Partial**—glass provides views, but elevation blocks meadow connection |
| Ecology | Sensitive meadow ecosystem | **Avoided rather than integrated**—building floats above, does not touch |
| Visitor journey | From parking to nature immersion | **Interrupted**—building as object between car and landscape |
| Climate | Seasonal extremes | **Partially addressed**—glass and steel, but no response to sun/snow |

**Site forces utilized:** Views (partially through glazing)
**Site forces ignored:** Topography, ecological integration, visitor journey, seasonal dynamics

### Integration Assessment

#### Ground Plane Continuity
The building deliberately disconnects from the ground via columns and concrete platform. Visitors climb stairs to enter—the opposite of ground continuity. The "minimal impact" intention ironically creates maximum experiential separation.

**Score:** 2/10
**Key findings:** Elevation breaks connection; platform creates artificial ground; landscape stops at building edge

#### Boundary Dissolution
Full glazing provides visual connection but physical barrier. No spaces where inside flows to outside. No covered outdoor areas. The glass creates an aquarium effect—you see nature but cannot inhabit it.

**Score:** 4/10
**Key findings:** Visual permeability high, physical flow absent, no transitional spaces

#### Topographic Response
The design explicitly ignores topography. A flat platform hovers over undulating meadow. The roof is flat. No artificial landform is created. The building could be placed on any flat site anywhere.

**Score:** 1/10
**Key findings:** Zero topographic response; site-generic design

#### Contextual Resonance
Glass-and-steel modernism does not resonate with the natural park context. While "neutral" was intended, the result is alien. Scale is acceptable but materials and form language have no relationship to the forest, meadow, or mountains.

**Score:** 3/10
**Key findings:** Materials alien; form language generic; scale acceptable

### Overall Integration Score

| Dimension | Score | Weighted |
|-----------|-------|----------|
| Ground Plane | 2/10 | 0.50 |
| Boundary Dissolution | 4/10 | 0.80 |
| Topographic Response | 1/10 | 0.25 |
| Contextual Resonance | 3/10 | 0.60 |
| Climate Response | 3/10 | 0.30 |
| **Total** | | **2.45/10** |

**Integration Level:** Object—building is placed on site with no integration

### Hadid Principle Applied

> "The building is not an object placed on a site. It is a new landscape itself."

This design embodies the opposite principle: the building is explicitly an object placed *above* the site, avoiding contact. The intention of "minimal impact" has created *maximum separation*. Visitors are removed from the landscape they came to experience.

A building can have minimal ecological impact while still being a landscape. Consider: a roof that becomes meadow, walls that are earth, floors that follow contours. Impact and integration are not opposites.

### Improvement Opportunities

If seeking better integration:

1. **Ground plane:** Lower the building to grade or below; let visitors walk onto a rising landform rather than climbing stairs to a platform. Consider earth-sheltering where the building emerges from the meadow.

2. **Boundary dissolution:** Create zones where inside and outside are continuous—covered outdoor rooms, walls that open fully, floors that extend to become terraces. Let visitors stand at the threshold of inside and outside simultaneously.

3. **Topographic response:** Follow the meadow's contours. Let the building rise and fall with the land. Consider a green roof that continues the meadow over the building.

4. **Contextual resonance:** Introduce materials that relate to context—stone, timber, earth. Consider forms that echo the mountain profile or the meadow's curves.

5. **Climate response:** Orient glazing to capture winter sun; provide shade structures for summer. Let the building respond to the seasons as the landscape does.

### Strengths

- Views are captured through extensive glazing
- The building's footprint is relatively small
- Reversibility is high if a better design replaces it

### Conclusion

This design mistakes "not touching" for "respecting." True respect for landscape means *becoming* landscape, not hovering above it. A visitor center should immerse visitors in nature, not separate them from it behind glass.

The building scores 2.45/10 on landscape integration. It is an object placed on—or rather, above—a site with virtually no integration. The design philosophy of "minimal impact" has paradoxically created maximal experiential disconnection.

Visitors come to a national park to be *in* nature. This building puts them *above* nature, looking down through glass. The very frame that was meant to be neutral becomes a barrier.

## Integration

This skill is part of the **Zaha Hadid** expert persona. Use it when assessing or designing for site integration. It pairs with:
- **fluid-space-design** for creating continuous indoor-outdoor experiences
- **parametric-design-analysis** for generating form from site forces
- **anti-orthogonal-challenge** for questioning whether rectangular buildings can integrate with organic landscapes
