# Principled Negotiation Stance

Nelson Mandela was uncompromising on fundamental principles - human dignity, racial equality, democratic governance - while being remarkably flexible on tactics - armed struggle vs. negotiation, timing of transition, power-sharing mechanisms, amnesty processes. This combination made him "the greatest negotiator of the twentieth century." The skill distinguishes between what you will never compromise on (principles) and what you're willing to discuss (tactics). Confusing the two creates either rigidity (treating preferences as sacred) or spinelessness (trading away what matters). Know the difference, and you can be both principled and effective.

## When to Use

- Before entering a significant negotiation
- When feeling pressure to compromise on values
- When uncertain what to be flexible about
- When negotiations have stalled due to rigidity
- When accused of being too flexible or too rigid
- User asks "What should I be flexible on?" or "What are my non-negotiables?"

## Core Principle

Confusing principles with tactics creates two failure modes: Too rigid (treating tactical preferences as principles, refusing to compromise on things that don't actually matter) and Too flexible (treating principles as negotiable tactics, compromising on core values). The key is sorting: principles are identity-defining commitments that, if violated, make "winning" actually losing. Tactics are means to principled ends that can take many forms.

---

## Methodology

### Phase 1: Clarify Your Principles
1. List what you believe you cannot compromise on
2. For each item, ask: "If I compromised on this and got everything else, would I feel like I won?"
3. If no: It's a principle. If yes: It may be a tactic.
4. Identify the core values beneath each principle

**Principles are:**
- Core values you will not violate
- Fundamental needs that cannot be traded away
- Identity-defining commitments
- Lines that, if crossed, make "winning" actually losing

### Phase 2: Identify Your Tactics
1. For each position you hold, ask: "Is there another way to achieve what I really need?"
2. If yes: It's a tactic - a means to an end
3. Identify what underlying principle each tactic serves
4. Generate alternative tactics that could serve the same principle

**Tactics are:**
- Means to achieve principled ends
- Positions you've taken but could change
- Specific demands that could be met other ways
- Preferences that are not identity-defining

### Phase 3: Sort Your Positions
For each element of your position, apply the sorting questions:
- Could I achieve my core values another way? (Yes = Tactic)
- Would compromising here violate who I am? (Yes = Principle)
- Is this a means or an end? (Means = Tactic)
- Would getting this without my deeper goals feel empty? (Yes = Tactic)

### Phase 4: Create Your Negotiation Stance
1. State principles clearly and early - explain why they're non-negotiable
2. Signal tactical flexibility - invite creative solutions
3. Map the trade space - what can you give, what can you get, what's off the table
4. Define walk-away conditions - what demands would violate principles

### Phase 5: Prepare for Common Confusions
1. Position vs. Interest: "I need $100K" (tactic) vs. "I need financial security" (closer to principle)
2. Method vs. Outcome: "We must do it this way" (tactic) vs. "We must achieve this outcome" (may be principle)
3. Timeline vs. Result: "By Tuesday" (tactic) vs. "It must happen" (may be principle)
4. Form vs. Substance: "Public apology" (tactic) vs. "Acknowledgment of harm" (closer to principle)

## Constraints

- Don't confuse stubbornness with principle
- Don't signal flexibility on principles even under pressure
- Ensure you've genuinely sorted principles from tactics
- Acknowledge that some situations require principled refusal
- Recognize when the other party is operating from principles vs. tactics
- Consider the cost of walking away before entering negotiation

---

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

- **Treating Preferences as Principles**: "We've always done it this way" or "I've already committed to this approach" are not principles. Ask: Does this define who I am, or is it just my current preference?

- **Treating Principles as Tactics**: "Maybe just this once..." or "They'll never agree unless I give on this" are warning signs. If it feels wrong to compromise, it may be a principle you're about to violate.

- **Rigidity Disguised as Principle**: Refusing to discuss alternatives because you're attached to your position, not because the principle requires it. True principles have no alternatives; tactics have many.

- **Flexibility Disguised as Strategy**: Compromising on principles because you're tired, because they're pushing hard, or because you want the deal done. That's not strategy; that's capitulation.

- **Not Knowing the Difference**: Entering negotiation without having sorted principles from tactics. This leads to ad-hoc decisions under pressure, which tend to be regrettable.

## Examples

### Example 1: Job Offer Relocation

**Situation**: Offered a dream job requiring relocation. Don't want to disrupt family. Company seems firm on relocation.

**Application**:
- Principle: Family stability - being present for family
- Tactic: "No relocation at all" - this is a means to family stability
- Alternative tactics: Partial presence, hybrid arrangements, delayed relocation, frequent travel

**Output**:
Principles (Non-negotiable):
- Being present for family (definition of "present" is negotiable)
- Not forcing family to move before they're ready

Tactics (Flexible):
- Current position: No relocation at all
- Alternatives: Hybrid with monthly on-site weeks; delayed relocation after school year; regional hub instead of HQ

Opening: "My family's stability is non-negotiable - that's not something I can trade. But I'm genuinely creative about how we solve the presence problem. Let me understand what you actually need from co-location."

### Example 2: Partnership Terms

**Situation**: Negotiating partnership with larger company. They want exclusivity; you want to maintain independence.

**Application**:
- Principle: Company independence - ability to make your own strategic decisions
- Tactic: "No exclusivity" - this is one way to protect independence
- Alternative tactics: Limited exclusivity (time-bound, category-specific, with exits)

**Output**:
Principles (Non-negotiable):
- Strategic independence - you cannot be acquired through the back door of a partnership
- Exit path - you must be able to leave if the partnership isn't working

Tactics (Flexible):
- Current position: No exclusivity at all
- Alternatives: 2-year exclusivity with renewal option; category-specific exclusivity; exclusivity with performance triggers

Opening: "We need to maintain our strategic independence - that's why we're partnering, not merging. But we're flexible on how to structure exclusivity so you get the commitment you need while we retain the autonomy we require."

### Example 3: Salary Negotiation

**Situation**: Negotiating salary. You have a number in mind. They've offered 20% less.

**Application**:
- Principle: Financial security for family (if this is truly non-negotiable for survival)
- Tactic: The specific number - this is a means to financial security
- Alternative tactics: Different base with bonus; equity; signing bonus; review in 6 months

**Output**:
Sorting exercise:
- Is "$X salary" a principle or tactic?
- If there's a minimum below which you cannot accept (rent, obligations), that minimum is closer to principle
- If it's your ideal number but you could live with less, it's a tactic

Principles (if applicable):
- I cannot accept below $X because that's the minimum I need for financial security

Tactics:
- Base salary (flexible if total comp is right)
- Timing of increases (can negotiate)
- Non-cash compensation (equity, benefits, flexibility)

Opening: "I need to reach total compensation of $X to meet my financial obligations - that's a real constraint. How we get there is a conversation."

## Integration

**Works with:**
- **preparation-audit**: Ensures you've prepared both principles and tactics
- **precedent-analysis**: Some negotiations set precedent that constrains future flexibility
- **premeditatio-malorum**: Envision worst case to clarify what you truly cannot accept

**When to prefer this skill:**
- Before any significant negotiation
- When feeling pressure to compromise and unsure if you should
- When negotiations have deadlocked over positions

**Cautions:**
- Sorting principles from tactics requires honest self-examination
- Some principles only become clear under pressure
- Don't over-communicate principles early - it can limit creative exploration
