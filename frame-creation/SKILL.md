# Frame Creation

A methodology for designating attention as the creative act, where establishing context transforms ordinary phenomena into significant experience.

## Description

Frame creation is the practice of recognizing that art, meaning, and significance are produced not by content but by the designation of attention. The creative act is not making something but making something noticeable. The frame says: attend to this. What's framed may be extraordinary or utterly ordinary—the frame is what transforms it.

This approach shifts the locus of creativity from production to perception. You don't need to create content; you need to create conditions for attention. What attention finds is not your business. Your business is the opening.

## When to Use
- When you want to reveal significance in the overlooked
- When content is abundant but attention is scarce
- When you're helping others see what's already present
- When creating experience rather than producing objects
- When curation matters more than creation
- When the audience's perception is the real medium
- When you want to make the invisible visible



## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| input_data | Yes | The primary data or content to analyze |
| context | No | Additional background or constraints (default: none) |
| output_format | No | Preferred format for results (default: structured markdown) |

## Workflow
### Step 1: Identify What's Already There

Before creating frames, survey the existing material. What sounds, sights, ideas, or phenomena are present but unnoticed? What has been filtered out by familiarity, habit, or assumption?

The best framing candidates are often things people encounter daily without attending to them.

### Step 2: Recognize the Frame's Power

Understand that the frame is not decoration or context—it is the creative act itself. The frame says "this is worth attending to" and in saying so, makes it so. The frame creates the art by designating attention.

### Step 3: Design the Frame Elements

A frame consists of several elements:

**Boundaries:** What's included and excluded? Where does attention begin and end?

**Duration:** How long does the frame hold attention? When does it start and stop?

**Context:** What surrounds the frame that gives it meaning? What expectations does it set?

**Legitimacy markers:** What signals that this is intentional, not accidental?

**Entry and exit:** How does the perceiver move into and out of the framed experience?

### Step 4: Minimize Your Presence

The frame should be visible enough to do its work but not so prominent that it becomes the subject. You're creating a window, not a painting. The frame directs attention; it shouldn't absorb attention.

### Step 5: Hold the Frame

Once established, maintain the frame without interfering with what happens inside it. Don't fill the space. Don't interpret for the perceiver. Don't apologize or explain. Trust the frame to do its work.

### Step 6: Let the Perceiver Complete the Work

The frame creates conditions; the perceiver creates meaning. What they notice, what they feel, what they conclude—this is their contribution. The work is collaborative. You provide the frame; they provide the attention. Together, significance emerges.

## Examples of Application

### Art and Curation
- The gallery wall that designates attention to what's hung on it
- The concert hall that makes ambient sounds musical
- The museum label that frames ordinary objects as significant
- The anthology that creates meaning through selection

### Writing and Communication
- Headlines that frame how content is received
- Context-setting before presenting information
- The title that shapes interpretation of everything after it
- Selective quotation that foregrounds particular meaning

### Experience Design
- Creating moments of designated attention in ordinary sequences
- The pause before important information
- Environmental cues that signal "pay attention to this"
- Rituals and ceremonies as attention-framing devices

### Teaching and Facilitation
- Framing observations as questions
- Designating reflection time within sessions
- "Notice this" as pedagogical intervention
- Creating conditions for discovery rather than delivering content

### Leadership and Communication
- Framing problems to make certain solutions visible
- Context-setting that shapes how information is interpreted
- Strategic naming that designates significance
- Agenda-setting as frame creation

### Personal Practice
- Treating daily experiences as framed for attention
- Walking as frame for attending to environment
- Meditation as frame for attending to mind
- Journaling as frame for attending to experience

## Key Principles

### The Frame Creates the Art
Art is not in the object but in the attention. The frame designates what deserves attention and in doing so creates significance. Without the frame, the content is just more undifferentiated reality.

### Everything Is Potential Content
Once you understand framing, you realize anything can be framed. The traffic noise, the conversation at the next table, the refrigerator hum—all potential art, awaiting only a frame.

### Attention Is the Medium
You're not working in paint, words, or sound. You're working in attention. The frame is your brush. What you're shaping is how and where and how long people attend.

### The Frame Must Be Visible
An invisible frame is indistinguishable from no frame. Something must signal "attend to this intentionally." The frame doesn't need to be heavy, but it needs to be perceptible.

### Don't Compete with the Content
The frame exists to direct attention, not to receive it. If people are looking at the frame instead of what's framed, the frame has failed. Good frames disappear into their function.

### The Perceiver Completes the Work
What happens inside the frame is collaboration between you (providing the frame) and the perceiver (providing the attention). Meaning emerges between these contributions. You don't control it; you enable it.

## Common Pitfalls

- **Overframing:** Making the frame so prominent it becomes the subject
- **Underframing:** Insufficient designation so attention disperses
- **Explanation:** Telling people what to notice instead of letting them discover
- **Control:** Trying to determine what perceivers experience rather than opening space
- **Content anxiety:** Doubting that the framed material is "enough" and adding to it
- **Arbitrary framing:** Framing without consideration of what the frame reveals

## The Ethical Dimension

Frame creation is powerful and can be used manipulatively. Framing shapes what people notice and therefore think and feel. Use this power with awareness:
- Frame to reveal, not to deceive
- Frame to open, not to narrow
- Frame to invite attention, not to coerce it
- Recognize that your framing choices carry responsibility

- Do not apply this framework to situations outside its intended scope
- Acknowledge that analysis is based on available data, which may be incomplete
- Honor the complexity of real-world situations that resist simple categorization
- Present findings with appropriate confidence levels
- Recognize the limits of the methodology
