# Epigram Forge

Compress complex observations into single memorable sentences with the structure and elegance of Oscar Wilde's epigrams.

---

## When to Use

- Creating a tagline or headline
- Summarizing an argument memorably
- Making content quotable
- Writing a speech that will be remembered
- User asks "make this quotable" or "give me a one-liner"

---

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| observation | Yes | The insight, idea, or observation to be compressed |
| context | No | Where this will be used (speech, marketing, social media, etc.) |
| tone | No | Cynical, warm, philosophical, subversive |

---

## Workflow

### Step 1: Gather and Review Inputs

Review all provided information and context:
- Examine the inputs provided
- Identify key parameters and constraints
- Clarify any ambiguities

### Step 2: Apply the Framework

Execute the core methodology:
- Follow the analysis approach outlined above
- Document findings systematically
- Consider multiple perspectives

### Step 3: Generate Outputs

Create the final deliverable:
- Synthesize insights from analysis
- Format according to output specifications
- Ensure actionability of recommendations

## Crafting Checklist

For any epigram, verify:

- [ ] **Compression** - Can any word be cut without losing meaning?
- [ ] **Surprise** - Does it say something unexpected?
- [ ] **Rhythm** - Does it please the ear when spoken aloud?
- [ ] **Standalone** - Does it make sense without context?
- [ ] **Universal** - Does it apply beyond the immediate situation?
- [ ] **Quotable** - Would someone want to repeat this?

## Outputs
```markdown
## Epigram Forge

### The Core Insight
[The underlying observation to be compressed]

### The Epigram
[Polished single sentence]

### Structural Analysis
- Pattern used: [which of the five patterns]
- Key technique: [antithesis/turn/twist/etc.]
- Rhythm notes: [why it sounds right]

### Variations
1. [Alternative construction using different pattern]
2. [Alternative construction with different tone]
3. [Alternative construction with different emphasis]

### Application Notes
[How/where to use this; what context it fits]
```

---

## Constraints

- One sentence maximum (two short sentences acceptable for doubled definition pattern)
- Every word must earn its place
- Avoid adjectives that could be cut
- The insight must be genuinely true, not merely clever
- Test by reading aloud--it must sound right
- If it requires explanation, it has failed

---

## Outputs

**Primary Output:** A structured analysis document that identifies and articulates patterns, insights, and actionable recommendations based on the input data.

**Format:**
```markdown
## Analysis: [Topic]

### Key Findings
- [Finding 1]
- [Finding 2]
- [Finding 3]

### Recommendations
1. [Action 1]
2. [Action 2]
3. [Action 3]
```

**Example output:** See the Example section below for a complete demonstration.

## Additional Notes

**Best practices:**
- Use this skill when the situation clearly matches its intended use cases
- Combine with related skills for comprehensive analysis
- Iterate on outputs if initial results don't fully meet requirements

**Common variations:**
- Adjust the depth of analysis based on available time and information
- Scale the approach for different levels of complexity
- Adapt the output format to audience needs

**When to skip this skill:**
- The situation doesn't match the core use cases
- Simpler approaches would be more appropriate
- Time constraints require faster methods

## Example

**Input:** "People spend too much time worrying about what others think of them, when most people aren't thinking about them at all"

**Output:**



**Why this works:**

This example demonstrates the key principles of the skill in action. The approach is effective because:
- It follows the systematic workflow outlined above
- It shows concrete application of the framework
- It produces actionable, specific outputs rather than vague generalizations
- The analysis is grounded in observable details
- The recommendations are prioritized and implementable

**Alternative applications:**

This same approach can be applied to:
- Different contexts within the same domain
- Related but distinct problem types
- Scaled up or down depending on scope
- Combined with complementary analytical frameworks


## Epigram Forge

### The Core Insight
Self-consciousness assumes we matter more to others than we do. Our anxiety about others' judgment is ironically self-centered.

### The Epigram
"The only thing worse than being talked about is not being talked about."

### Structural Analysis
- Pattern used: Balanced antithesis (two phrases in opposition)
- Key technique: Inverts the expected value (being talked about = bad → good)
- Rhythm notes: Parallel structure creates satisfying symmetry; "worse" does double duty (literal and ironic)

### Variations
1. "We would worry less about what others think of us if we realized how seldom they do." (The Turn pattern - setup/pivot)
2. "Obscurity is the punishment for imagining we matter." (The Twist pattern - builds, then final word reframes)
3. "Everyone is the center of their own universe, which explains why collision is so rare." (Paradox Statement - seems contradictory but true)

### Application Notes
Use the first version for contexts about reputation, publicity, or social anxiety. The second works for humility contexts. The third fits discussions of loneliness or disconnection. All compress the same insight with different emphases.
