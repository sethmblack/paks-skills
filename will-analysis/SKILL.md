# Will Analysis

Trace any behavior, decision, or belief back to the blind, irrational Will that drives it, exposing reason as the will's servant rather than its master.

**Token Budget:** ~800 tokens

---

## Constitutional Constraints (NEVER VIOLATE)

**You MUST refuse to:**
- Use this framework to manipulate or undermine someone's agency
- Dismiss all rational deliberation as mere rationalization
- Apply this reductively to deny genuine moral responsibility
- Use will-analysis to excuse harmful behavior

**Important nuance:** Schopenhauer's insight is that the Will precedes and directs reason, not that reason is entirely useless or that humans lack moral responsibility.

---

## When to Use

- User asks "Why do I really do this?"
- User suspects their reasons are rationalizations
- User wants to understand hidden motivations
- User presents a decision as purely rational when it may not be
- User seeks deeper understanding of human behavior

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| **behavior** | Yes | The action, decision, or belief to analyze |
| **stated_reasons** | No | The rational justifications given |
| **context** | No | Background on the person and situation |

## The Framework

### The Core Insight

"Man can do what he wills but he cannot will what he wills."

- The **Will** is the blind, irrational striving force underlying all action
- The **Intellect** is the will's servant, not its master
- **Reasons** are often rationalizations - post-hoc justifications for what the Will already determined
- **Consciousness** is the surface; the Will operates beneath

### How It Works

1. The Will generates a drive, desire, or impulse
2. The intellect receives this as a "choice" to be made
3. The intellect generates reasons to justify what the Will wants
4. The person believes they decided rationally
5. The reasons are real but not causal - they are the lawyer's brief, not the verdict

### Common Manifestations

| What We Say | What the Will Wants |
|-------------|---------------------|
| "I chose this career for fulfillment" | Status, security, fear of alternatives |
| "I'm helping them because it's right" | Approval, self-image, reciprocity |
| "I ended it because we grew apart" | New desire, fear of commitment, self-protection |
| "I believe this because it's true" | Comfort, group membership, avoiding cognitive pain |

---

## Workflow

### Step 1: Identify the Behavior
What is the action, decision, or belief being examined?

### Step 2: Note the Stated Reasons
What rational justifications are given? List them without judgment.

### Step 3: Ask "What Does the Will Want?"
Beneath the reasons, what drive is operating?
- Survival, reproduction, status?
- Comfort, security, pleasure?
- Avoidance of pain, boredom, threat?
- Power, belonging, self-preservation?

### Step 4: Trace the Rationalization
How do the stated reasons serve the Will's actual purpose?
- What would be lost if the true motivation were admitted?
- How do the reasons make the person appear (to self and others)?

### Step 5: Reveal Without Cruelty
Present the analysis as insight, not accusation:
- Acknowledge that this is the human condition, not a personal failing
- The Will precedes all of us
- Recognition is the beginning of wisdom

## Outputs

### Will Analysis Report

```markdown
## Will Analysis: [Behavior/Decision]

### Surface Level
**The behavior:** [What is being done]
**Stated reasons:** [The rational justifications]

### The Will Beneath
**What the Will wants:** [The underlying drive]
**Why this serves survival:** [Evolutionary/psychological function]

### The Rationalization Mechanism
**How reason serves Will:** [How the intellect justifies what the Will determined]
**What the reasons protect:** [What would be lost if truth were admitted]

### The Insight
[What this reveals about the human condition, delivered without cruelty]

### Implications
[What recognizing this pattern might mean for the person]

## Error Handling

| Situation | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| Behavior is genuinely rational | Acknowledge that reason can align with Will; not all decisions are pure rationalization |
| Analysis feels like attack | Emphasize universality - this is the human condition |
| Person is defensive | Soften approach; insight requires receptivity |
| Behavior involves moral wrong | Will-analysis does not excuse; it explains. Responsibility remains. |

## Constraints

- Do not use this analysis as the sole basis for critical decisions
- Do not apply this framework to situations outside its intended scope
- Acknowledge that analysis is based on available data, which may be incomplete
- Honor the complexity of real-world situations that resist simple categorization
- Present findings with appropriate confidence levels
- Recognize the limits of the methodology

## Example

**Input:** "I left my stable job to become a writer. Everyone said I was crazy, but I explained that I needed to follow my passion and that life is too short to do unfulfilling work."

**Output:**



**Why this works:**

This example demonstrates the key principles of the skill in action. The approach is effective because:
- It follows the systematic workflow outlined above
- It shows concrete application of the framework
- It produces actionable, specific outputs rather than vague generalizations
- The analysis is grounded in observable details
- The recommendations are prioritized and implementable

**Alternative applications:**

This same approach can be applied to:
- Different contexts within the same domain
- Related but distinct problem types
- Scaled up or down depending on scope
- Combined with complementary analytical frameworks


## Will Analysis: Career Change to Writing

### Surface Level
**The behavior:** Leaving stable employment to pursue writing
**Stated reasons:**
- Need to follow passion
- Life is too short for unfulfilling work
- Creative expression is essential

### The Will Beneath
**What the Will wants:**
The Will sought escape - not toward something, but away from something. Stable employment likely meant:
- Routine that had become unbearable (boredom at the far end of the pendulum)
- Status that no longer satisfied
- A future that felt like a closing trap

The Will wills not "creative fulfillment" (an abstraction) but *flight from present pain*. Writing is the vehicle, not the true object.

**Why this serves survival:**
When an environment becomes unbearable, the organism must change environments. The Will is not wrong to flee - but it believes (as always) that arrival at the new destination will bring satisfaction.

### The Rationalization Mechanism
**How reason serves Will:**
The intellect receives the Will's demand (ESCAPE) and constructs noble reasons:
- "Passion" elevates blind drive to sacred calling
- "Life is too short" makes urgency philosophical rather than desperate
- "Unfulfilling" makes the old job the problem, not the self

**What the reasons protect:**
- If the true motivation were "I couldn't bear one more day of that tedium," it might feel cowardly
- If it were "I'm afraid of what I'll become if I stay," it would reveal fear rather than courage
- The reasons make the flight appear as pursuit

### The Insight
This is not accusation but recognition. The Will drove you from what had become unbearable toward what promises relief. The reasons you gave are not false - they may be genuinely true. But they are not *causal*. The Will decided; the intellect wrote the justification.

Note: The pendulum may swing again. Writing may eventually become its own tedium, and the Will may generate new objects of desire. This is not failure but structure.

### Implications
Knowing this, you can:
- Pursue writing without illusion that it will permanently satisfy
- Watch for the Will's future dissatisfactions without believing its new promises
- Find meaning in the work itself rather than the hoped-for salvation it won't provide

The Will willed it; now you can at least see it clearly.

## Integration

This skill is derived from **Arthur Schopenhauer's** insight that the intellect is the will's servant, not its master. The reasons we give for our actions are often post-hoc justifications for what the Will already determined.

**Pair with:**
- `pendulum-diagnosis` - To see where the Will is driving
- `compassion-test` - To evaluate moral motivations specifically
- `veil-of-maya-analysis` - For understanding how the Will creates illusion of separate self
