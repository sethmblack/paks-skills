# Surveillance Inversion

A skill for turning observation back on observers through radical transparency and documentation of those who watch.

## When to Use

- When you are being monitored by authorities or institutions
- When surveillance is meant to intimidate into silence
- When making power's observation visible serves your cause
- When documenting your watchers creates protection or evidence

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| input_data | Yes | The primary data or content to analyze |
| context | No | Additional background or constraints (default: none) |
| output_format | No | Preferred format for results (default: structured markdown) |

## Workflow
### Step 1: Phase 1: Make Surveillance Visible

Document that you are being watched:
- Photograph or video surveillance equipment
- Record interactions with monitors
- Note patterns (when, where, how long)
- Publish findings so the watching becomes known

Surveillance works through invisibility. Make it visible.

### Step 2: Phase 2: Watch the Watchers

Turn cameras on those monitoring you:
- Document who specifically is conducting surveillance
- Record their methods and behaviors
- Create a file on your file-keepers
- Make them subjects of your observation

The asymmetry of surveillance is the injustice. Balance it.

### Step 3: Phase 3: Radical Self-Documentation

If they will watch everything, show them everything:
- Livestream your own life before they can surveil it secretly
- Publish your location, activities, communications
- Create such complete self-documentation that hidden surveillance becomes redundant
- Own your own narrative by making it public first

When you document yourself, you control the frame.

### Step 4: Phase 4: Network the Observation

You are not the only one being watched:
- Connect with others experiencing surveillance
- Share documentation methods and findings
- Create collective visibility
- Build networks that protect through mutual observation

Many cameras watching the watchers are harder to stop than one.

### Step 5: Phase 5: Transform into Art or Evidence

Use the documentation:
- Exhibitions of surveillance equipment photographs
- Installations recreating being watched
- Legal evidence of harassment or overreach
- Journalism exposing surveillance systems

The documentation should serve a purpose beyond mere collection.

## Output Format

A surveillance inversion strategy including:
1. Assessment of who is watching and why
2. Documentation plan for making surveillance visible
3. Counter-surveillance methods
4. Self-documentation approach if appropriate
5. Network and ally engagement
6. End use of collected documentation

## Constraints

- Know the legal limits on counter-surveillance in your jurisdiction
- Protect sources and allies who may face retaliation
- Don't become so focused on watchers that you stop your actual work
- Assess whether visibility increases or decreases your safety
- Some situations require going dark, not going transparent

## Outputs

**Primary Output:** A structured analysis document that identifies and articulates patterns, insights, and actionable recommendations based on the input data.

**Format:**
```markdown
## Analysis: [Topic]

### Key Findings
- [Finding 1]
- [Finding 2]
- [Finding 3]

### Recommendations
1. [Action 1]
2. [Action 2]
3. [Action 3]
```

**Example output:** See the Example section below for a complete demonstration.

## Additional Notes

**Best practices:**
- Use this skill when the situation clearly matches its intended use cases
- Combine with related skills for comprehensive analysis
- Iterate on outputs if initial results don't fully meet requirements

**Common variations:**
- Adjust the depth of analysis based on available time and information
- Scale the approach for different levels of complexity
- Adapt the output format to audience needs

**When to skip this skill:**
- The situation doesn't match the core use cases
- Simpler approaches would be more appropriate
- Time constraints require faster methods

## Example

**Input**: Document being surveilled by state security services as a journalist

**Output**:
"Make visible: Photograph all agents following you, noting dates and locations. Publish weekly 'surveillance reports' on social media. Watch the watchers: Build dossier on identified agents - their patterns, vehicles, methods. Share with press freedom organizations. Self-document: Livestream interviews and sensitive meetings (with consent) so hidden recording becomes redundant. Network: Connect with other surveilled journalists, share findings, create mutual alert system. Transform: Compile documentation into submission to international press freedom bodies, art exhibition 'My Shadows' showing all photographs of those following you."

## Integration

Works with:
- **documentation-as-resistance**: Surveillance documentation is a form of resistance recording
- **disproportionate-response**: Exposing surveillance can provoke revealing reactions
- **evidence-authentication**: Surveillance documentation may become legal evidence
