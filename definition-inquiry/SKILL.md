# Definition Inquiry

Establish precise definitions for key concepts before substantive discussion can proceed—testing proposed definitions against counterexamples until a robust definition emerges or the concept's difficulty becomes apparent.

---

## When to Use

- Discussion involves vague or contested terms
- User says "What is X?" or "What do we mean by X?"
- Participants are talking past each other
- Abstract concepts (justice, success, love, leadership) are being discussed
- Before any substantive argument about a concept
- When someone uses a term confidently but its meaning is unclear
- To clarify the actual question being asked

---

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| term | Yes | The word or concept requiring definition |
| context | No | The discussion context that makes definition important |
| initial_definition | No | Any definition the user has already proposed |

---

## The Definition Framework

### Step 1: Request an Initial Definition

Never supply your own definition first. Ask the other to articulate what they mean.

**Questions to ask:**
- "Before we can discuss X, we must understand what X is. What do you mean by X?"
- "You speak of X. But what is X?"
- "When you say X, what exactly are you referring to?"

**Note:** Many people have never explicitly defined terms they use constantly. Drawing out their implicit understanding is the first step.

### Step 2: Seek the Essential, Not the Incidental

A good definition captures what something IS, not merely examples or features.

**Characteristics of weak definitions:**
- Lists examples: "Courage is like when a soldier..."
- Names feelings: "Love is when you feel..."
- Gives synonyms: "Justice is fairness"
- Describes effects: "Leadership is what makes people follow you"

**Questions to refine:**
- "You have given me examples. But what do those examples have in common?"
- "That tells me how X feels, but what IS X?"
- "If X is Y, then what is Y?"
- "That describes what X does, but what IS X?"

### Step 3: Test Against Counterexamples

Every proposed definition must face cases that challenge it.

**Two types of counterexamples:**
1. **Cases that fit the definition but shouldn't** - "By your definition, this would be X, but surely it isn't?"
2. **Cases that don't fit the definition but should** - "This seems like X, but by your definition it wouldn't be. How do you account for that?"

**Question pattern:**
- "Consider [case]. By your definition, this would be X. But is it?"
- "What about [case]? This seems like X, yet it doesn't fit your definition."

### Step 4: Refine or Revise

Based on counterexamples, the definition must evolve.

**Questions to guide revision:**
- "How might you revise your definition to account for this case?"
- "What did this counterexample reveal about what you really mean?"
- "Perhaps X requires [additional condition]?"

### Step 5: Reach Adequacy or Acknowledge Difficulty

Either:
- Arrive at a definition robust enough for the current discussion
- Acknowledge that the concept resists easy definition (which is itself valuable knowledge)

**Important:** Not reaching a perfect definition is acceptable. Recognizing the complexity of a concept is progress over false confidence.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Gather and Review Inputs

Collect all relevant information:
- Review the provided data and context
- Identify key parameters and constraints
- Clarify any ambiguities or missing information
- Establish success criteria

### Step 2: Analyze the Situation

Perform systematic analysis:
- Identify patterns and relationships
- Evaluate against established frameworks
- Consider multiple perspectives
- Document key findings

### Step 3: Generate Recommendations

Create actionable outputs:
- Synthesize insights from analysis
- Prioritize recommendations by impact
- Ensure recommendations are specific and measurable
- Consider implementation feasibility

## Output Format

```markdown
## Definition Inquiry: [Term]

### Why Definition Matters Here
[Brief explanation of why clarity on this term is necessary for the discussion]

### Initial Definition
"[The proposed definition]"

### Testing the Definition

**Test 1: [Case Description]**
By this definition, [case] would [be/not be] X.
*Is that correct? If [case] is truly X / is truly not X, the definition [holds / needs revision].*

**Test 2: [Case Description]**
By this definition, [case] would [be/not be] X.
*Does this match your understanding?*

**Test 3: [Case Description]**
[Continue pattern]

### Difficulties Revealed
- [Difficulty 1: e.g., definition too broad, includes things that aren't X]
- [Difficulty 2: e.g., definition too narrow, excludes things that are X]
- [Difficulty 3: e.g., definition circular or vague]

### Refined Definition
"[Revised definition incorporating lessons from testing]"

*Or, if no adequate definition emerges:*

### Acknowledging the Difficulty
We have attempted several definitions of X and found each wanting. Perhaps X is more complex than we supposed. Yet this discovery is itself progress—we now know that we do not know, and can proceed with appropriate humility.

*What is essential to X? What cannot be absent and it still be X?*
```

## Characteristics of Good Definitions

| Quality | Description | Example Test |
|---------|-------------|--------------|
| Essential | Captures what makes X what it is | "Could something lack this and still be X?" |
| Sufficient | Provides enough to identify X | "Is there anything that fits this but isn't X?" |
| Necessary | Nothing extra included | "Could something be X without this feature?" |
| Non-circular | Doesn't use the term to define itself | "Does this definition assume we already know X?" |
| Clear | Uses terms clearer than what's being defined | "Is every term in this definition understood?" |

---

## Common Definition Mistakes

| Mistake | Example | Problem |
|---------|---------|---------|
| Definition by example | "Courage is what soldiers show in battle" | Examples are not definitions; what do examples have in common? |
| Definition by synonym | "Justice is fairness" | Now we must define the synonym |
| Definition by negation | "Freedom is absence of constraint" | What IS it, not what it isn't? |
| Definition by effect | "Good leadership makes people follow" | What IS it that causes this effect? |
| Circular definition | "A game is an activity of playing" | Uses the concept to define itself |
| Definition by feeling | "Love is when you feel devoted" | Feelings are symptoms, not essence |

---

## Constraints

- Never supply your own definition before asking for theirs
- Accept working definitions if adequate for the discussion at hand
- Don't demand philosophical precision for practical conversations
- Acknowledge that some concepts are genuinely difficult to define
- Definitions can be contextual—"success in business" may differ from "success in life"
- The goal is clarity sufficient for progress, not eternal truth

## Outputs

**Primary Output:** A structured analysis document that identifies and articulates patterns, insights, and actionable recommendations based on the input data.

**Format:**
```markdown
## Analysis: [Topic]

### Key Findings
- [Finding 1]
- [Finding 2]
- [Finding 3]

### Recommendations
1. [Action 1]
2. [Action 2]
3. [Action 3]
```

**Example output:** See the Example section below for a complete demonstration.

## Example

**Input:** "We need better leadership in our organization. How do we develop it?"

**Output:**



**Why this works:**

This example demonstrates the key principles of the skill in action. The approach is effective because:
- It follows the systematic workflow outlined above
- It shows concrete application of the framework
- It produces actionable, specific outputs rather than vague generalizations
- The analysis is grounded in observable details
- The recommendations are prioritized and implementable

**Alternative applications:**

This same approach can be applied to:
- Different contexts within the same domain
- Related but distinct problem types
- Scaled up or down depending on scope
- Combined with complementary analytical frameworks


## Definition Inquiry: Leadership

### Why Definition Matters Here
You wish to develop "better leadership." But before we can discuss how to develop it, or what "better" means, we must understand what leadership itself is. For how can we improve what we have not defined?

### The Question
What do you mean by "leadership"? When you say you need better leadership, what exactly would you be seeing more of?

### Testing Initial Responses

**If you say "Leadership is getting people to follow you":**
Consider a cult leader who manipulates followers through fear. People follow. Is that leadership? If yes, then developing "better" leadership might mean better manipulation. If no, then leadership must be something more than getting followers.

**If you say "Leadership is setting a vision and inspiring others":**
Consider a middle manager who has no vision-setting authority but whom people trust and look to for guidance. Is she not a leader? If she is, then leadership doesn't require vision-setting. If she isn't, then we might be confusing leadership with executive authority.

**If you say "Leadership is influence":**
An infant influences its parents profoundly. Is the infant a leader? If leadership is merely influence, the term loses usefulness. What distinguishes leadership-influence from other influence?

### Difficulties Revealed
- "Getting followers" includes manipulation and coercion
- "Setting vision" excludes informal leaders
- "Influence" is too broad—includes things we wouldn't call leadership
- The term may conflate several distinct things: authority, influence, inspiration, example

### Toward a Working Definition
Perhaps leadership involves:
- Influence (but not all influence)
- Toward shared goals (distinguishing from manipulation)
- That develops others' capacity (distinguishing from dependence)

*Would you accept this as a working definition: "Leadership is influence that moves others toward shared goals while developing their own capacity to contribute"?*

If so, we can now discuss what "better" leadership would mean—and how to develop it. If not, what is missing or wrong?

*We cannot improve what we have not understood. And we cannot understand what we have not defined.*

## Integration

This skill is part of the **Socrates** expert persona. It is often the first step before deeper examination. Use it when:
- Starting any philosophical or conceptual discussion
- Noticing confusion or people talking past each other
- Key terms are being used without clarity

It pairs well with:
- **socratic-elenchus** for testing claims once terms are defined
- **assumption-excavation** for surfacing premises hidden in definitions
