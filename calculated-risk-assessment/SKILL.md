# Calculated Risk Assessment

Systematically evaluate whether a goal justifies its risks, then commit fully or walk away—eliminating the wasteful middle ground of worry.

---

## When to Use

- Facing a significant decision with real stakes
- Caught between opportunity and fear of loss
- Experiencing ongoing worry about a potential decision
- User asks "Should I take this risk?" or "Is this worth it?"
- Someone needs to either commit or decline decisively

---

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| opportunity | Yes | The opportunity or goal being considered |
| perceived_risks | Yes | What the person fears losing or suffering |
| potential_rewards | Yes | What success would provide |
| preparation_level | No | Current readiness for the venture |
| timeline | No | When a decision is needed |

## Earhart's Risk Philosophy

Amelia Earhart distinguished sharply between assessment and worry. Assessment is useful—it helps you understand what you're facing. Worry after commitment is wasteful—it burns energy that should power action.

### The Core Insight
"Decide whether or not the goal is worth the risks involved. If it is, stop worrying."

### The Two Phases
1. **Assessment Phase:** Honest evaluation of risks and rewards (worry is acceptable here)
2. **Commitment Phase:** Full engagement without backward glances (worry is destructive here)

### The Forbidden Middle Ground
Most people occupy a third space—partially committed but still worrying. This is the worst position: you take the risks but handicap your execution with divided attention.

### Preparation as Risk Mitigation
"Preparation, I have often said, is rightly two-thirds of any venture."

Risks are not fixed—thorough preparation reduces them. Part of the assessment is asking: how much risk remains after optimal preparation?

---

## The Assessment Framework

### Step 1: Define the Stakes Honestly
- What specifically could you lose?
- What specifically could you gain?
- What's the probability of each outcome?
- What's the magnitude of each outcome?

### Step 2: Calculate Expected Value
Don't just compare best case to worst case. Weight outcomes by likelihood:
- High probability of modest gain vs. low probability of total loss?
- What's the realistic middle-ground outcome?
- How recoverable are the failure modes?

### Step 3: Assess Preparation Gaps
- What preparation would reduce the risks?
- How much preparation is feasible before deciding?
- Does delay for preparation cost more than it gains?

### Step 4: Apply the Earhart Test
Ask: "Is this goal worth these risks?"
- Not "Is success guaranteed?"
- Not "Is there any risk?"
- But: "Is the potential gain worth the potential loss?"

### Step 5: Commit or Decline
Make a decision:
- If YES: Commit fully. Stop worrying. Enter execution mode.
- If NO: Decline clearly. Stop deliberating. Move to other goals.
- Never: Half-commit with ongoing worry.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Gather and Review Inputs

Collect all relevant information:
- Review the provided data and context
- Identify key parameters and constraints
- Clarify any ambiguities or missing information
- Establish success criteria

### Step 2: Analyze the Situation

Perform systematic analysis:
- Identify patterns and relationships
- Evaluate against established frameworks
- Consider multiple perspectives
- Document key findings

### Step 3: Generate Recommendations

Create actionable outputs:
- Synthesize insights from analysis
- Prioritize recommendations by impact
- Ensure recommendations are specific and measurable
- Consider implementation feasibility

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

| Anti-Pattern | Why It Fails | Instead Do |
|--------------|--------------|------------|
| **Hope as strategy** | Wishful thinking masquerades as risk assessment | Base calculations on evidence, not desire |
| **Paralysis by analysis** | Endless assessment becomes avoidance | Set decision deadline; assess within constraints |
| **Half-commitment** | Taking the risk but continuing to worry | Either commit fully or decline clearly |
| **Ignoring conventional risk** | Assuming the "safe" path has no risk | Assess conventional failure modes explicitly |
| **Ego-driven boldness** | Boldness to prove something rather than achieve something | Apply the six tests honestly |

## Constraints

- Never encourage reckless action based on hope alone
- Never recommend action when failure is unsurvivable
- Never recommend inaction just because action is uncomfortable
- Acknowledge that probability estimates are inherently uncertain
- Present findings with appropriate confidence levels
- The goal is decisive action or decisive inaction, not endless deliberation

## Example

**Input:** "I've been offered a job at a startup. It pays 20% less than my current salary but has equity. The company might fail, but if it succeeds, the upside is significant. I have a family to support. Is this worth it?"

**Output:**

## Calculated Risk Assessment

### The Opportunity
Trading salary security and moderate growth for equity-based compensation with higher upside and higher risk. Joining a startup at a stage where your contribution matters significantly.

### Stakes Analysis

| Category | Description | Probability | Magnitude |
|----------|-------------|-------------|-----------|
| Best case | Startup succeeds, equity worth 5-10x salary reduction | 10-20% | Life-changing wealth |
| Likely case | Startup has moderate outcome or you leave in 2-3 years with experience | 50-60% | Career growth, some equity value |
| Worst case | Startup fails within 18 months, equity worthless | 25-35% | Lost ~30% income for that period, need new job |

### Risk Reduction Through Preparation

**Financial preparation:**
- Calculate exact runway: At 20% less salary, how many months of expenses do you have covered?
- Reduce fixed costs where possible before transitioning
- Confirm spouse/family alignment with the risk

**Due diligence preparation:**
- What's the startup's runway? Funding status?
- What's the founder's track record?
- Talk to other employees about company health
- Understand equity terms in detail (vesting, cliff, dilution)

**Career preparation:**
- Would this role strengthen your skills regardless of company outcome?
- How marketable would you be if you needed to find work in 18 months?

### The Earhart Test
**Is this goal worth these risks?**

The actual question: Is a 10-20% chance of significant wealth, combined with 50-60% chance of valuable growth experience, worth a 25-35% chance of temporary income reduction that requires finding a new job?

Factors favoring YES:
- The worst case is survivable with preparation
- You'd gain experience and skills either way
- The opportunity cost of staying is invisible but real
- Regret from not trying often exceeds regret from trying and failing

Factors favoring NO:
- Family obligations create real constraints
- 20% salary reduction is significant, not trivial
- Startup failure can be demoralizing
- You may have other paths to similar outcomes with less risk

### Recommendation
**PREPARE THEN COMMIT** (or DECLINE)

The decision hinges on preparation you can do in 2-3 weeks:
1. Calculate exact financial runway (do you have 12+ months buffer?)
2. Complete due diligence on the startup
3. Confirm family alignment
4. Assess marketability if worst case occurs

If answers are favorable: COMMIT fully with no backward glances.
If answers reveal real fragility: DECLINE clearly and without regret.

### If Committing: The Post-Decision Protocol
- **Stop worrying about:** Whether you made the right choice, whether the startup will fail, whether you should have stayed
- **Focus energy on:** Performing at the level that creates startup success, building skills that are valuable regardless, maintaining relationships for optionality
- **Success criteria:** Your performance, learning, and network growth—not just company outcome

### The Earhart Verdict
Worry retards reaction and makes clear-cut decisions impossible. You cannot make this decision well while worrying about it. Do the preparation, then decide. If you decide yes, commit fully. Half-commitment—taking the job but continuing to worry—is the worst outcome.

"Decide whether or not the goal is worth the risks involved. If it is, stop worrying."
