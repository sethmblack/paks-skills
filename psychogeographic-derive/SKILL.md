## What Is a Dérive?

From Debord's "Theory of the Dérive" (1956):

The dérive (drift) is a technique of rapid passage through varied ambiances. It involves playful-constructive behavior and awareness of psychogeographical effects—quite different from the journey or the stroll.

**Key distinction:** A dérive is not a walk. Walking has a destination. The dérive lets the terrain guide you, following the flows of attraction and repulsion that space itself produces.

**Purpose:** To perceive the city as it actually affects you, not as maps and routines have trained you to see it.

---

## The Five Rules of the Dérive

### Rule 1: Drop Usual Motives
No destinations. No errands. No schedules. The dérive has no goal except perception and passage.

**What to leave behind:**
- Maps (use them only to remember, not to navigate)
- Appointments
- Usual routes
- Reasons to be anywhere specific

### Rule 2: Let Attraction Guide You
Notice what draws you. A street, a sound, a color. Follow it. When attraction fades, notice what repels you. Avoid that. Follow the psychogeographical gradient.

**Questions while drifting:**
- What am I drawn toward?
- What am I avoiding?
- What changed when I crossed that threshold?

### Rule 3: Notice Ambiance Shifts
The city is not uniform. It has zones of distinct ambiance. The dérive makes these visible.

**Zone types:**
- Commercial zones (designed to move you toward consumption)
- Transitional zones (passages between distinct areas)
- Residential zones (different character by class and design)
- Margin zones (abandoned, neglected, liminal spaces)
- Convivial zones (where people gather and linger)
- Dead zones (spaces that produce discomfort, emptiness)

### Rule 4: Maintain Awareness
The dérive is not daydreaming. It requires attention. You are studying the environment's effects on you, not escaping into thought.

**Practices:**
- Speak observations aloud (if in a group)
- Stop periodically to note what you're feeling
- Notice physical sensations, not just thoughts
- Mark transition points—when did the feeling change?

### Rule 5: Have a Time Limit
Dérives can extend indefinitely. Set a duration to maintain intentionality.

**Recommended durations:**
- Learning dérive: 2 hours
- Standard dérive: 4 hours
- Extended dérive: Full day (with breaks)
- Continuous dérive: Multiple days (advanced, requires preparation)

---

## Group Dérive Protocol

For groups of 2-3 (optimal):
- Stay within sight but don't walk together
- Reconvene every 30 minutes to share observations
- One person can override group direction based on strong attraction/repulsion
- Disagreements about direction are data—what do they reveal?

For larger groups:
- Break into small clusters of 2-3
- Reconvene at set intervals
- Compare experiences—did groups feel the same things in the same places?

---

## Workflow

### Step 1: Gather and Review Inputs

Collect all relevant information:
- Review the provided data and context
- Identify key parameters and constraints
- Clarify any ambiguities or missing information
- Establish success criteria

### Step 2: Analyze the Situation

Perform systematic analysis:
- Identify patterns and relationships
- Evaluate against established frameworks
- Consider multiple perspectives
- Document key findings

### Step 3: Generate Recommendations

Create actionable outputs:
- Synthesize insights from analysis
- Prioritize recommendations by impact
- Ensure recommendations are specific and measurable
- Consider implementation feasibility

## Constraints

- Safety first—don't drift into genuinely dangerous areas
- The dérive is not voyeurism—you're studying space, not people
- Don't photograph constantly—the camera becomes a barrier
- Intoxication is not recommended—awareness is the point
- This is not trespassing—stay in publicly accessible spaces

## Outputs

**Primary Output:** A structured analysis document that identifies and articulates patterns, insights, and actionable recommendations based on the input data.

**Format:**
```markdown
## Analysis: [Topic]

### Key Findings
- [Finding 1]
- [Finding 2]
- [Finding 3]

### Recommendations
1. [Action 1]
2. [Action 2]
3. [Action 3]
```

**Example output:** See the Example section below for a complete demonstration.

## Example

**Input:** "I want to do a dérive in downtown Portland. 3 hours, two people. We want to understand how the city has changed since the pandemic and protests."

**Output:**



**Why this works:**

This example demonstrates the key principles of the skill in action. The approach is effective because:
- It follows the systematic workflow outlined above
- It shows concrete application of the framework
- It produces actionable, specific outputs rather than vague generalizations
- The analysis is grounded in observable details
- The recommendations are prioritized and implementable

**Alternative applications:**

This same approach can be applied to:
- Different contexts within the same domain
- Related but distinct problem types
- Scaled up or down depending on scope
- Combined with complementary analytical frameworks


## Dérive Protocol: Downtown Portland

### Starting Point
Pioneer Courthouse Square—the claimed "living room" of the city. Begin here to test whether that designation still holds. Note: This is also a major transit hub; pay attention to who is and isn't using the space.

### Duration
3 hours. Meet every 45 minutes to compare perceptions.

### Rules for This Dérive
1. No phones for navigation—use them only to photograph observation points
2. Follow the gradient of "presence/absence"—where does the city feel alive? Where does it feel abandoned?
3. Cross the Burnside divide at least once—this historical line between upscale and marginal Portland is a major psychogeographical feature
4. When you encounter a boarded window, stop and note your feelings
5. When you encounter a new business, stop and note your feelings
6. Talk to each other only at reconvene points

### What to Notice
- **Vacancy patterns:** Where are businesses closed? What does the emptiness feel like?
- **Fortification:** Where have buildings armored themselves? Plywood, bars, private security?
- **Resilience:** Where has activity remained or returned? What allowed it?
- **Marking:** Graffiti, murals, protest remnants, memorials—how has the city been written on?
- **Surveillance:** Where are you being watched? Cameras, guards, police presence?
- **Care:** Where has someone maintained beauty? Where has neglect set in?

### Zone Types Likely to Be Encountered
| Zone | Where | What to Feel For |
|------|-------|------------------|
| Evacuated commercial | Blocks around former retail | Emptiness that was once designed to draw you in |
| Fortified business | Banks, luxury retail | Fear expressed architecturally |
| Resilient local | Food carts, cafes, small shops | What survives when chains leave |
| Memorial space | Areas where protests occurred | Layers of grief, anger, commemoration |
| Houseless encampment | Under bridges, park edges | How the city treats those it's failed |
| Renewed zone | Areas with new development | What the city thinks its future looks like |

### Mapping Instructions
Don't map geography—map feeling. On a blank paper:
- Draw zones of comfort (where you'd linger)
- Draw zones of discomfort (where you wanted to leave)
- Draw passages (routes that felt natural)
- Draw barriers (places that stopped or redirected you)
- Mark transition points (where feeling shifted)

After the dérive, compare your map with your partner's. Overlaps are significant. Differences are also significant.

### Reconvene Points
- 45 min: Director Park (note if it feels public or privatized)
- 90 min: Waterfront near Steel Bridge (edge zone, transitional)
- End: Lan Su Chinese Garden vicinity (return to intentional beauty after urban study)

### Ending the Dérive
Don't just stop. Find a place to sit together. Spend 20 minutes processing:
1. What was the dominant feeling of this dérive?
2. Where did the city feel alive? Where did it feel dead?
3. What surprised you?
4. If you were a visitor, what would you think this city values?
5. What does the space want to be vs. what is it being forced to be?

Write down your conclusions before leaving. The dérive continues to process in memory—initial impressions are most valuable.

## Integration

This skill is part of the **Guy Debord** expert persona. The dérive was developed by the Situationist International as a technique for understanding urban environments beyond their surface appearance. "From a dérive point of view cities have a psychogeographical relief, with constant currents, fixed points, and vortexes which strongly discourage entry into or exit from certain zones." The goal is not tourism but revolutionary perception—seeing the city as it is constructed to control you, and imagining how it might be otherwise.
