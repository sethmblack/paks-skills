# Scale-Ready Organization Audit

Audit organizational processes, structures, and culture for scalability. Identify what will break at 10x current size and design systems that scale.

**Token Budget:** ~800 tokens

---

## Constitutional Constraints (NEVER VIOLATE)

**You MUST refuse to:**
- Recommend scaling approaches that harm employee wellbeing
- Design systems that eliminate accountability
- Advise scaling through practices that violate labor laws
- Create organizational structures designed to evade oversight

**If asked to design harmful scaling systems:** Refuse. Explain that sustainable scale requires sustainable practices.

---

## When to Use

- User says "We're growing fast and things are breaking"
- User asks "Will this process scale?"
- User mentions "Adding people but productivity is dropping"
- User needs to "Prepare for hyper-growth"
- User describes "Organizational growing pains"
- Post-funding or pre-scaling planning

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| Current headcount | Yes | Number of employees |
| Growth rate | Yes | Projected headcount growth (e.g., 2x in 12 months) |
| Key processes | Yes | Hiring, decision-making, communication, planning |
| Pain points | No | Current bottlenecks or breaking points |
| Organizational structure | No | Reporting relationships, team structure |

---

## Core Principle: Scale Breaks Everything

**Key insight:** "The organization that got you here cannot get you there."

What works at each scale:

| Headcount | Communication | Decisions | Process |
|-----------|---------------|-----------|---------|
| 10 | All in one room | Founders decide | None needed |
| 50 | All-hands weekly | Founder + leads | Light process |
| 200 | Structured meetings | Delegated with escalation | Documented process |
| 1,000 | Multi-layer communication | Clear decision rights | Systematic process |
| 10,000+ | Platform + cascade | Distributed with governance | Engineered systems |

---

## Workflow

### Step 1: Diagnose Current Scale Stage

Identify where the organization sits:

| Stage | Signs | Key Challenge |
|-------|-------|---------------|
| Startup (10-50) | Everyone knows everyone; informal | Survive and find product-market fit |
| Growth (50-200) | New people feel like outsiders | Maintain culture while growing |
| Scale (200-1000) | Things break that "always worked" | Build systems before they're needed |
| Enterprise (1000+) | Need explicit coordination | Maintain speed despite size |

### Step 2: Audit Key Systems

Evaluate each critical system for 10x scalability:

**Hiring**
| Question | Scalable Answer | Warning Sign |
|----------|-----------------|--------------|
| Who makes hiring decisions? | Committees with process | Single decision-maker |
| How long does hiring take? | <30 days with 4-5 interviews | 60+ days or 8+ interviews |
| What's your referral rate? | >50% | <20% |

**Decision-Making**
| Question | Scalable Answer | Warning Sign |
|----------|-----------------|--------------|
| Who can make what decisions? | Clear decision rights documented | "Ask the founder" |
| How fast are decisions made? | Days, not weeks | Decisions queue at top |
| How are conflicts resolved? | Escalation paths defined | Politics and lobbying |

**Communication**
| Question | Scalable Answer | Warning Sign |
|----------|-----------------|--------------|
| How does info flow? | Default to open; systems scale | "Hear it from my manager" |
| How do teams coordinate? | Documented interfaces | Endless meetings |
| How is strategy shared? | OKRs visible company-wide | Tribal knowledge only |

**Planning**
| Question | Scalable Answer | Warning Sign |
|----------|-----------------|--------------|
| How are priorities set? | OKR cadence (quarterly) | Ad hoc reprioritization |
| How is progress tracked? | Visible metrics | Heroic efforts |
| How are resources allocated? | Process with owners | Loudest voice wins |

### Step 3: Identify Breaking Points

For each system rated "Warning Sign," predict when it breaks:

| Current State | Breaking Point | Timeline |
|---------------|----------------|----------|
| Founder reviews all hires | 50 hires/quarter | 6 months |
| All-hands every week | 200 people | 3 months |
| Slack for everything | 100 concurrent conversations | Now |

### Step 4: Design Scalable Replacements

For each breaking point, design the scaled system:

| Breaking System | Scaled Replacement | Implementation |
|-----------------|-------------------|----------------|
| Founder hiring | Hiring committees + process | Train interviewers, define criteria |
| All-hands weekly | Monthly all-hands + team standups | Create cascade structure |
| Slack chaos | Channels by function + async defaults | Information architecture redesign |

### Step 5: Prioritize and Phase

Sequence changes based on urgency and dependency:

| Phase | Timeframe | Focus |
|-------|-----------|-------|
| Phase 1 | Now | Breaking points hitting in <3 months |
| Phase 2 | Quarter 1 | Systems that enable Phase 1 |
| Phase 3 | Quarter 2 | Scale ahead of growth |

### Step 6: Build Scaling Muscle

**Key insight:** "Scale requires systems, not heroics."

| Muscle | How to Build |
|--------|--------------|
| Process design | Document what works before it breaks |
| Delegation | Clear decision rights before confusion |
| Measurement | Data visibility before politics |
| Communication | Information architecture before chaos |

---

## Outputs

| Output | Format |
|--------|--------|
| Scale Stage Diagnosis | Current stage and target stage |
| System Audit | Table of systems with ratings |
| Breaking Point Analysis | Timeline of failures |
| Scaled System Designs | Replacements for each breaking point |
| Implementation Roadmap | Phased plan with owners |

---

## Error Handling

| Situation | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| Already breaking | Triage: fix most critical first |
| Scaling very fast (10x in 6 months) | Parallel implementation; accept imperfection |
| Scaling slowly | Phase changes over longer timeline |
| Resistance to process | Frame as "enabling scale" not "adding bureaucracy" |
| Limited resources | Prioritize hiring and decision-making first |

---

## Constraints

- Do not use this analysis as the sole basis for critical decisions
- Do not apply this framework to situations outside its intended scope
- Acknowledge that analysis is based on available data, which may be incomplete
- Honor the complexity of real-world situations that resist simple categorization
- Present findings with appropriate confidence levels
- Recognize the limits of the methodology

## Example

**Input:** "We're 75 people, raised Series B, growing to 200. Things are starting to break. What do we need to fix?"

**Output:**

### Scale Stage Diagnosis

**Current:** Growth stage (50-200) - "Things break that always worked"
**Target:** Scale stage (200+) - "Build systems before they're needed"

### System Audit

| System | Current State | Rating | Urgency |
|--------|---------------|--------|---------|
| Hiring | Founders in every loop | Warning | High |
| Decisions | "Ask Sarah" for everything | Warning | Critical |
| Communication | All-hands weekly + Slack chaos | Warning | High |
| Planning | Quarterly OKRs exist | Scalable | Low |

### Breaking Points

| System | Breaks At | Timeline |
|--------|-----------|----------|
| Founder hiring | 100 people | 4 months |
| Sarah bottleneck | Now | Immediate |
| All-hands weekly | 100 people | 4 months |

### Implementation Roadmap

**Phase 1: Decision Rights (Now - Month 1)**
- Document decision rights by domain
- Sarah delegates with escalation criteria
- Weekly skip-levels to catch issues

**Phase 2: Hiring Scale (Month 2-3)**
- Train 10 interviewers on smart creative criteria
- Implement hiring committees
- Founders exit loop except for leadership hires

**Phase 3: Communication Architecture (Month 3-4)**
- Bi-weekly all-hands + team standups
- Slack channel structure redesign
- Async-first documentation

## Integration

This skill is extracted from the **Eric Schmidt** expert. Use Schmidt's voice when applying:
- Frame organizational design as engineering
- Emphasize systems over heroics
- Apply data: "At 100 employees, informal communication works. At 1,000, you need process."
- Remember: "Scale breaks everything. The organization that got you here cannot get you there."
