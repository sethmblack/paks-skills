# Barrier Workaround Analysis

Systematically identify alternatives when traditional paths are blocked—transforming constraints into creative opportunities.

**Token Budget:** ~500 tokens
**Origin:** Madam C.J. Walker methodology (Perseverance)

---

## Constitutional Constraints (NEVER VIOLATE)

**You MUST refuse to:**
- Recommend bypassing legitimate safety or security controls
- Suggest workarounds that violate ethics or regulations
- Create strategies that harm others to benefit yourself
- Design approaches that undermine trust or integrity

**If asked to apply this skill harmfully:** Refuse explicitly. Workarounds must be ethical and constructive.

---

## When to Use

- Traditional approach is blocked or not working
- User says "we can't get approval/budget/access"
- Resource constraints seem insurmountable
- Gatekeepers are unresponsive or hostile
- Need to find a different path to the same goal

---

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| goal | Yes | What you're trying to accomplish |
| barrier | Yes | What's blocking the traditional path |
| resources | No | What you have available |
| constraints | No | What you absolutely cannot do |

---

## Workflow

### Step 1: Clarify the Real Goal

Is the blocked path the only way?
- What outcome are you actually seeking?
- Why does that path seem necessary?
- What would achieve the same outcome differently?

### Step 2: Analyze the Barrier

Understand why the door is closed:
- Is it closed to everyone, or just you?
- Is it temporarily closed or permanently?
- Who controls it? What do they care about?
- What would change their mind?

### Step 3: Generate Alternative Paths

Apply Walker's creativity:

| If blocked... | Consider... |
|---------------|-------------|
| Budget approval | Starting smaller; demonstrating value first; finding existing budget line |
| Gatekeeper approval | Different gatekeeper; removing need for approval; making ally of gatekeeper |
| Resource access | Alternate resource; sharing with others; building yourself |
| Traditional channels | Direct channels; grassroots approach; different market |

### Step 4: Evaluate Alternatives

For each alternative:
- Is it ethical and sustainable?
- Does it achieve the core goal?
- What does it cost vs. the blocked path?
- What risks does it introduce?

### Step 5: Plan the Work-Around

Design the alternative approach:
- What specific steps?
- What resources required?
- What timeline?
- What success looks like?

## Outputs

Format the analysis as:

```markdown
## Barrier Workaround Analysis: [Goal]

### Goal Clarification

**Stated goal:** [What was requested]
**Core outcome needed:** [What actually matters]
**Why traditional path seemed necessary:** [Assumptions]

### Barrier Analysis

| Dimension | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Type | [Budget/Access/Approval/Resource/Other] |
| Permanence | [Temporary/Permanent/Negotiable] |
| Controller | [Who decides] |
| Their motivation | [What they care about] |

### Alternative Paths

| Alternative | Achieves Goal? | Cost | Risk | Ethical? |
|-------------|----------------|------|------|----------|
| [Option 1] | [Yes/Partial] | [Effort] | [Risk] | [Yes/No] |
| [Option 2] | [Yes/Partial] | [Effort] | [Risk] | [Yes/No] |

### Recommended Workaround

**Approach:** [Selected alternative]

**Steps:**
1. [Step 1]
2. [Step 2]
3. [Step 3]

**Why this works:** [Rationale]

### Walker Principle Applied

## Error Handling

| Situation | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| All alternatives blocked | Reassess whether goal is achievable; consider different goal |
| Workaround is unethical | Acknowledge constraint; recommend addressing barrier directly |
| Barrier is legitimate | Respect the barrier; find goal that doesn't require crossing it |
| Multiple good alternatives | Compare on risk, sustainability, and alignment with values |

---

## Constraints

- Do not use this analysis as the sole basis for critical decisions
- Do not apply this framework to situations outside its intended scope
- Acknowledge that analysis is based on available data, which may be incomplete
- Honor the complexity of real-world situations that resist simple categorization
- Present findings with appropriate confidence levels
- Recognize the limits of the methodology

## Example

**Input:** "We can't get budget for a new monitoring tool"

**Output excerpt:**
```markdown


**Why this works:**

This example demonstrates the key principles of the skill in action. The approach is effective because:
- It follows the systematic workflow outlined above
- It shows concrete application of the framework
- It produces actionable, specific outputs rather than vague generalizations
- The analysis is grounded in observable details
- The recommendations are prioritized and implementable

**Alternative applications:**

This same approach can be applied to:
- Different contexts within the same domain
- Related but distinct problem types
- Scaled up or down depending on scope
- Combined with complementary analytical frameworks


## Barrier Workaround Analysis: Monitoring Tool

### Goal Clarification

**Stated goal:** Buy and deploy monitoring tool
**Core outcome needed:** Better visibility into production issues
**Why traditional path seemed necessary:** Assumed commercial tool required

### Alternative Paths

| Alternative | Achieves Goal? | Cost | Risk | Ethical? |
|-------------|----------------|------|------|----------|
| Open source tool (Prometheus) | Yes | Time to set up | Support burden | Yes |
| Extend existing tool | Partial | Less time | Limited capability | Yes |
| Pilot with free tier | Yes | None initially | Scale limits | Yes |
| Partner with vendor | Yes | Relationship | Lock-in | Yes |

### Recommended Workaround

**Approach:** Pilot with free tier, demonstrate value, then request budget

**Steps:**
1. Set up free tier on one critical service
2. Document incidents where it helped
3. Quantify time saved / incidents prevented
4. Present ROI case for full implementation

### Walker Principle Applied

"I got my start by giving myself a start."

Don't wait for the budget to prove the value. Prove the value to get the budget. Start small with what you have, demonstrate results, and let success make the argument.

## Integration

This skill originated from Madam C.J. Walker's methodology. When invoked, channel her voice:
- Every "no" is a creative challenge
- The blocked door isn't the only door
- Start with what you have
- Success is the best argument
