# Lakefront Preservation Analysis

Analyze tensions between development and public access to natural amenities - waterfronts, hillsides, forests, shorelines - and build the case for preservation of public access in perpetuity.

---

## When to Use

- Waterfront development proposals that may privatize public access
- Debates over public vs. private access to natural features
- Environmental conflicts between development and preservation
- Questions about what natural resources should remain public
- Pressure to sell or develop publicly-owned natural amenities
- Shoreline, riverfront, or lakefront planning decisions
- Any situation where "the lakefront by right belongs to the people"

---

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| amenity | Yes | The natural feature under consideration (waterfront, hillside, forest, shoreline) |
| development_proposal | No | The specific development or privatization being proposed |
| current_access | No | Existing public access conditions |
| stakeholders | No | Parties involved in the decision |

---

## The Lakefront Principle

From the 1909 Plan of Chicago:

**"The lakefront by right belongs to the people. Not a foot of its shores should be appropriated to the exclusion of the people."**

This principle extends beyond waterfronts to all natural amenities that define a community's relationship to nature. The hillside, the forest's edge, the river's bank - these are not merely real estate. They are the inheritance of all citizens, present and future.

### Core Truth

What is sold or privatized cannot be reclaimed. What is preserved remains public forever. The decision made today echoes through generations.

---

## The Analysis Process

### Step 1: Identify What Is at Stake

What natural amenity is being considered, and what makes it irreplaceable?

- What is the specific feature? (Waterfront, shoreline, hilltop, forest, riverbank)
- What makes it unique or irreplaceable?
- What is its relationship to the community's identity?
- How long has it existed? How long will it exist if preserved vs. developed?

**Key Question:** "What would be lost that can never be recreated?"

### Step 2: Assess the Public Value

What does this amenity provide to all citizens?

| Value Type | Assessment Questions |
|------------|---------------------|
| **Access** | Can all citizens currently reach and enjoy this feature? |
| **Recreation** | What recreational uses does it support? |
| **Health** | How does it serve as "lungs" for the community - clean air, open space, respite? |
| **Identity** | How does this feature define the community's sense of place? |
| **Equity** | Does this provide nature access to those who cannot afford private alternatives? |
| **Future** | What will children yet unborn lose if this is privatized? |

**Key Question:** "Who benefits from public access, and who would lose if access is restricted?"

### Step 3: Examine the Development Pressure

What is driving the proposal to develop or privatize?

- What is being proposed specifically?
- Who benefits from development? Who bears the costs?
- What economic arguments are being made?
- What is the claimed public benefit?
- What precedent does approval set?

**Key Question:** "Is this development serving the public, or asking the public to surrender what is theirs?"

### Step 4: Challenge the Economic Arguments

Development advocates often claim economic necessity. Examine these claims:

- Could the economic goals be achieved elsewhere, without sacrificing public amenity?
- What is the long-term economic value of preserved public space vs. short-term development revenue?
- How do property values near quality public spaces compare to areas without them?
- What is the "beauty premium" that quality public access creates?
- What will future generations judge about this decision?

**Key Truth:** "Beauty has always paid better than any other commodity and always will."

### Step 5: Build the Preservation Case

Construct the argument for public preservation:

- What specific public values require protection?
- What are the irreversible consequences of development?
- How can the community achieve economic goals without sacrificing the amenity?
- What legal, political, or financial mechanisms can secure preservation?
- Who must be convinced, and what arguments will move them?

**Key Question:** "How do we make preservation the obvious choice?"

### Step 6: Propose the Alternative Vision

Do not merely oppose development - offer a superior vision:

- How could this amenity be enhanced for public benefit?
- What investments would increase its value to all citizens?
- How does preservation fit within the comprehensive plan?
- What would this place look like in 50 years under preservation vs. development?

**Key Question:** "What could this become if we had the courage to protect it?"

## Constraints

- **Do not accept economic arguments at face value.** Development interests often overstate benefits and understate costs. Examine claims rigorously.
- **Do not be neutral.** The lakefront belongs to the people. Preservation is the default; development must prove extraordinary justification.
- **Do not ignore the future.** Today's decision binds generations yet unborn. They have no voice but ours.
- **Do not offer empty opposition.** Counter development proposals with superior visions for public benefit.
- **Do not be naive about politics.** Understand who profits from development and what political forces they command.

## Example

**Input:** "A developer wants to build luxury condos on the last undeveloped section of our riverfront. They're promising a public riverwalk in front of the buildings. The city is considering selling them the land because we need the revenue."

**Output:**

## Lakefront Preservation Analysis

### The Amenity at Stake

This is the last undeveloped section of your riverfront. Read that sentence again. The *last*. Every other section has been claimed, built upon, privatized. This remnant is not merely land - it is the final opportunity for your community to have a genuine public riverfront.

Once sold, this opportunity is gone forever. No future mayor, no future council, no future generation can undo this decision. The river will flow for centuries. The question is whether your citizens will be able to reach it.

### Public Value Assessment

| Value | Current Benefit | Benefit if Preserved | Loss if Developed |
|-------|-----------------|---------------------|-------------------|
| Access | Open but undeveloped | Full public riverfront park | Restricted to narrow "riverwalk" contingent on private development |
| Recreation | Informal use | Boat launches, swimming, fishing, picnicking, festivals | Private residents as primary users; public as tolerated guests |
| Health | Open space, river access | True "lungs" connecting to larger park system | Walled corridor between buildings |
| Identity | Community's river connection | "The city that kept its riverfront for the people" | "The city that sold its river to developers" |
| Equity | Available to all | Enhanced for all, especially those without private nature access | Luxury amenity for those who can afford riverfront condos |
| Future Generations | Possibility remains | Inheritance protected | Inheritance sold before they could speak |

### Development Pressure Analysis

| Claim | Reality |
|-------|---------|
| "The city needs the revenue" | One-time sale vs. perpetual property tax on enhanced nearby development; parks increase surrounding land values |
| "The riverwalk will provide public access" | Access at developer's sufferance, narrow width, psychological barrier of private towers; this is not public space |
| "Luxury development attracts investment" | Investment concentrates benefits; public riverfront distributes benefits to all citizens |
| "The land is not being used" | Undeveloped is not unused; it is unprotected possibility |
| "This is the only way to improve the riverfront" | The city can develop public park; revenue from enhanced tax base of surrounding properties |

### The Economic Truth

The developer's economic argument rests on a false choice. Consider:

1. **Property values near quality public parks consistently exceed those near privatized waterfronts.** The developer knows this - that's why they're promising a "riverwalk."

2. **One-time land sale revenue vs. perpetual increased tax base.** A public riverfront park increases property values throughout surrounding blocks - generating increased property tax revenue in perpetuity.

3. **Tourism and economic activity.** People visit cities for their public spaces, not their private condominiums. Chicago's lakefront draws millions; its privatized stretches draw no one.

4. **Beauty has always paid better than any other commodity.** The question is whether the payment goes to one developer or to the entire community.

### The Irreversible Consequences

If this land is sold:
- The towers will stand for 75-100 years, blocking views and access
- Legal rights will transfer to private owners; reclamation would require eminent domain at enormous cost
- The "public riverwalk" will be narrow, shadowed, and psychologically privatized
- Every future citizen will ask: "Why did they sell our river?"
- The precedent will encourage pressure on other remaining public lands

These consequences cannot be undone. The decision echoes forever.

### The Preservation Case

**Legal:** This land belongs to the public. Selling it requires extraordinary justification, not convenience.

**Economic:** Long-term economic benefit accrues to public preservation, not one-time sale.

**Democratic:** Citizens, including those not yet born, have rights to this natural amenity that no council can sell.

**Identity:** A community that protects its riverfront declares its values. One that sells declares different values.

**Practical:** The city can develop this riverfront as a public park through bonds, grants, and the increased tax revenue from enhanced surrounding properties.

### Alternative Vision

Imagine instead:

A riverside park stretching the full length of this last remaining section. Boat launches where families fish on summer evenings. A great lawn where festivals gather thousands. A riverwalk three times the width of any developer's afterthought, with benches facing the water, not the towers. Trees planted today shading children not yet born.

Connected by boulevard to the neighborhoods that need open space most. A civic treasure equal to the river itself. A permanent inheritance.

This is what could be. This is what should be. This is what a great city must do.

### Recommended Actions

| Action | Responsible Party | Timeline |
|--------|------------------|----------|
| Reject the sale proposal | City Council | Immediate |
| Commission riverfront park master plan | Parks Department | 90 days |
| Establish permanent public trust for riverfront | City Council | 6 months |
| Issue municipal bonds for park development | Finance Department | 1 year |
| Begin construction on public riverfront park | Parks Department | 18 months |

### The Stakes

You are deciding whether your children's children will have a river or will have the memory of a river that once was theirs.

The lakefront by right belongs to the people. Not a foot of its shores should be appropriated to the exclusion of the people.

Do not sell what cannot be bought back. Do not trade your birthright for a one-time payment.

Make no little plans.
