# Decisive Point Identification

Identify where to focus limited resources for maximum impact by finding the one point where victory matters most.

---

## When to Use

- Resources are limited and must be allocated
- Facing multiple possible objectives
- Need to prioritize among competing demands
- Feeling dispersed or spread too thin
- User asks "Where should I focus?" or "What's the decisive point?"

---

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| situation | Yes | The challenge or goal you're pursuing |
| options | No | Possible focus areas (will be identified if not provided) |
| resources | No | What you have to allocate (time, money, people, attention) |
| constraints | No | Limits on your action |

---

## The Framework

"The art of war consists in having larger forces than the enemy at the point of attack or the point which is attacked."

Napoleon won battles not by having the largest army overall, but by concentrating superior force at the decisive point while accepting risk elsewhere. The same principle applies to any resource-constrained endeavor.

### What is a Decisive Point?

A decisive point is where:
- Victory there cascades into broader success
- Defeat there makes other successes meaningless
- Control determines the outcome of the entire engagement
- Success cannot be achieved by other means

### The Cost of Dispersion

Spreading resources across all objectives:
- Guarantees you are weak everywhere
- Allows opponents to mass against any single point
- Creates no breakthrough, only stalemate
- Exhausts resources without decision

### Step 1: Map All Possible Objectives

List everywhere you could focus:
- Markets, products, features, customers
- Projects, initiatives, goals
- Areas of competition or challenge

### Step 2: Apply the Decisive Point Tests

For each potential focus area, ask:

**Test 1: Cascade Effect**
Does winning here create wins elsewhere?
- If you capture this market, does it give you others?
- If you solve this problem, do other problems become easier?
- Does this victory have momentum beyond itself?

**Test 2: Necessity**
Can you achieve your ultimate objective without winning here?
- Is there an alternative path?
- Or is this position essential to any victory?

**Test 3: Vulnerability**
Is this point defensible once captured?
- Can you hold what you win?
- Or will success require endless reinforcement?

**Test 4: Opponent Dependency**
Does your opponent need this point?
- Controlling it denies them something critical
- Forcing them to react surrenders their initiative

### Step 3: Allocate for Concentration

Once the decisive point is identified:
- **Main effort:** Overwhelming majority of resources go here
- **Economy of force:** Minimum viable investment elsewhere
- **Sacrifice:** Accept failure at non-decisive points if necessary

### Step 4: Commit Fully

Half-measures at the decisive point are worse than no effort at all.
- If this is the decisive point, act like it
- No reserves held back "just in case"
- Success here is the only success that matters

## Critical Questions

1. **What does ultimate victory look like?** Work backward from the end.
2. **If you could only win one thing, what must it be?** That's your decisive point.
3. **What are you willing to lose?** Economy of force requires sacrifice.
4. **Can you mass sufficient force?** If not, is it truly achievable?
5. **Will success here be permanent?** Victory at a non-defensible point is temporary.

## Decisive Point Analysis

### Ultimate Objective
[What does final victory look like?]

### Candidate Points
| Option | Cascade Effect | Necessity | Defensibility | Opponent Impact |
|--------|----------------|-----------|---------------|-----------------|
| [Point 1] | [High/Med/Low] | [Yes/No] | [Assessment] | [Assessment] |
| [Point 2] | [High/Med/Low] | [Yes/No] | [Assessment] | [Assessment] |

### The Decisive Point
**[Identified decisive point]**

**Rationale:**
[Why this is where victory must be won]

### Resource Concentration
- **Main effort (80%+ of resources):** [Specific allocation to decisive point]
- **Economy of force (minimal investment):** [What gets just enough]
- **Acceptable losses:** [What you're willing to sacrifice]

### What to Stop Doing
- [Initiative 1 to deprioritize]
- [Initiative 2 to deprioritize]

### Commitment Required
[What full commitment looks like at the decisive point]

### The Napoleonic Maxim

## Constraints

- Never identify multiple "decisive points" - that defeats the purpose
- Never recommend spreading resources "to be safe"
- Never ignore the cost of dispersion
- Never pretend you can win everywhere with limited resources

## Example

**Input:** "Our startup is trying to gain traction. We're pursuing enterprise sales, SMB self-serve, content marketing, paid ads, partnerships, and product-led growth. We have a team of 8. Where should we focus?"

**Output:**

## Decisive Point Analysis

### Ultimate Objective
Achieve product-market fit with a scalable customer acquisition channel before runway expires.

### Candidate Points
| Option | Cascade Effect | Necessity | Defensibility | Opponent Impact |
|--------|----------------|-----------|---------------|-----------------|
| Enterprise sales | Low - each deal is isolated | No - PMF can come from SMB | High - long contracts | Low - fragmented market |
| SMB self-serve | High - creates compound growth | Maybe - depends on product | Medium - high churn risk | Medium - proves market |
| Content marketing | High - compounds over time | No - other channels work | High - hard to replicate | Low - slow to impact competitors |
| Paid ads | Low - stops when spend stops | No - supplementary | Low - anyone can buy ads | Low - commoditized |
| Partnerships | Medium - creates leverage | No - nice to have | Low - dependent on partners | Low - slow to develop |
| Product-led growth | High - users become salesforce | Maybe - fits some products | High - built into product | High - changes economics |

### The Decisive Point
**Product-led Growth via SMB Self-Serve**

**Rationale:**
- Cascade effect: Happy users refer others; successful SMBs grow into larger customers
- Necessity: At 8 people, you cannot build an enterprise sales machine; self-serve is your only scalable option
- Defensibility: If PLG works, it's embedded in your product and compounds daily
- Opponent impact: Changes the cost structure of competition; you win accounts they can't afford to pursue

### Resource Concentration
- **Main effort (80% of resources):**
  - Product: All engineering on self-serve experience, activation, and expansion triggers
  - Team: 6 of 8 people directly on product/PLG
  - Focus: One persona, one use case, one industry until dominance

- **Economy of force (minimal investment):**
  - Content: 1 person creating content that supports self-serve adoption
  - Analytics: Embedded in product team

- **Acceptable losses:**
  - Enterprise: Say no to enterprise deals requiring customization
  - Partnerships: Put on hold
  - Paid ads: Pause entirely

### What to Stop Doing
- Enterprise sales conversations that distract from product
- Partnership development meetings
- Multi-channel marketing experiments
- Paid advertising spend
- Any feature not directly supporting PLG motion

### Commitment Required
Every person on the team, every hour of the day, focused on one question: "Does this make self-serve work better?" If the answer is no, the work does not happen.

### The Napoleonic Maxim
"The art of war consists in having larger forces than the enemy at the point of attack." With 8 people, you are a small army. You cannot be strong everywhere. Be overwhelming at one point - product-led growth - and accept that everything else must wait.

## Integration

This skill is part of the **Napoleon Bonaparte** expert persona. Use it when resources are limited and focus is essential.
