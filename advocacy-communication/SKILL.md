## Roosevelt's Advocacy Method

### The "My Day" Approach

For 27 years, Eleanor Roosevelt wrote a daily newspaper column reaching over 4 million readers. She made it work by:

**Being personal:** She shared her daily experiences, meetings, travels—making readers feel they knew her personally.

**Being purposeful:** Within that personal frame, she consistently advocated for civil rights, women's rights, human dignity, and social justice.

**Being accessible:** She wrote as if to a dear friend—never lecturing, never condescending, always inviting.

### From Personal to Universal

Roosevelt's signature move: start with an individual experience, then expand to universal significance.

> "When I visited those camps and saw the faces of displaced persons—mothers holding children, men who had lost everything—I understood that human rights is not an abstraction."

The individual face makes the abstract principle real.

### Advocacy Without Manipulation

Roosevelt inspired without exploiting fear or anger. She appealed to what she called "the better angels of our nature"—the human capacity for compassion and justice. Her advocacy was:

- Honest about challenges, not alarmist
- Hopeful about possibility, not naive
- Firm about principles, not rigid about methods
- Inviting participation, not demanding obedience

### The Core Insight

> "Where, after all, do universal human rights begin? In small places, close to home—so close and so small that they cannot be seen on any maps of the world."

Effective advocacy connects the grand cause to where people actually live.

## The Advocacy Communication Process

### Step 1: Ground in Human Story

Abstract principles don't move people. Human faces do.

**Find the story:**
- A specific person affected by this issue
- Your own experience that drew you to the cause
- A moment when the stakes became real

**Make it concrete:**
- Names (when appropriate), places, details
- What did you see, hear, feel?
- What made this personal?

### Step 2: Expand to Principle

From the specific story, draw out the universal significance.

**Ask:**
- Why does this individual story matter beyond itself?
- What principle is at stake here?
- How does this connect to values my audience already holds?

**Connect to shared values:**
- Fairness, dignity, opportunity
- Protecting the vulnerable
- Living up to our stated ideals
- The world we want our children to inherit

### Step 3: Make the Case Without Manipulation

Roosevelt's advocacy was ethical—she inspired without exploiting.

**Do:**
- Present facts honestly, including complexity
- Acknowledge legitimate concerns of those who disagree
- Appeal to highest motivations (justice, compassion, courage)
- Trust your audience to make good decisions with good information

**Don't:**
- Exaggerate threats or consequences
- Demonize opponents
- Use shame or guilt as primary motivators
- Oversimplify in ways that deceive

### Step 4: Provide Actionable Next Steps

Inspiration without direction is incomplete. Every appeal should answer: "What can I do?"

**Make actions:**
- Specific (not "help" but "call your representative about...")
- Achievable (start with what anyone can do)
- Scalable (offer options from small to significant)
- Immediate (something they can do today)

### Step 5: End with Hope and Agency

Leave your audience feeling capable, not overwhelmed.

> "It is not enough to talk about peace. One must believe in it. And it isn't enough to believe in it. One must work at it."

Close with:
- Confidence in the audience's capacity
- Vision of what's possible
- Reminder that individual actions matter
- Invitation to be part of something larger

## Advocacy Communication

### The Human Story

Last month, I had lunch with my eight-year-old niece. She asked me what I do at work, and I explained as best I could. Then she asked, "Does your company help the planet?"

I paused. I wanted to say yes with confidence. Instead, I found myself saying, "We're working on it."

That moment stayed with me. Not because I think a child's question should determine corporate strategy, but because it reminded me of something I'd been pushing aside: We're not doing everything we could.

### The Principle at Stake

This isn't about perfection. It's about direction. Every company will exist somewhere on a spectrum from doing nothing to doing everything possible. The question isn't whether we can solve climate change alone—of course we can't. The question is: Are we moving in the right direction?

Our stated values include being responsible corporate citizens. Our employees—many of you—have asked about this. Our customers increasingly factor sustainability into their decisions. This is about living up to who we say we are.

### The Case for Action

**What we know:**
- Our current practices generate approximately [X] tons of carbon annually
- Three relatively straightforward changes could reduce that by 30% in the first year
- The upfront investment would be recovered within 18 months through reduced energy costs
- 67% of employees in our recent survey said sustainability matters to them in choosing where to work

**What skeptics reasonably ask:**
- "Isn't this just going to add cost without real impact?"
  - Actually, the initiatives with the best ROI are also the most sustainable ones. We're not proposing sacrifice; we're proposing smarter operations.
- "Shouldn't we focus on our core business?"
  - Sustainability is becoming core business. Customers, investors, and talent all increasingly factor it in.
- "Will this really make a difference?"
  - Any individual company's impact is small. But that logic applies to every company, which is why every company must act. We do our part; others do theirs.

**Why it matters now:**
We're expanding. The systems we build now will determine our footprint for years. It's easier to build right than to retrofit later.

### What You Can Do

**Today:**
- Sign up for the sustainability committee (link below)—we need voices from every department
- Reply to this email with your ideas—what inefficiencies have you noticed that we could address?

**This week:**
- Review the proposal document and share feedback through the form
- Talk to your team about what sustainability might mean for your specific work

**Ongoing:**
- Join the monthly working group sessions
- Propose initiatives for our quarterly sustainability sprints
- Be part of measuring and celebrating our progress

### Closing Appeal

I'm not asking you to save the planet. I'm asking you to help us do better than we're doing—together, practically, without pretending we have all the answers.

Every large change begins with people who decided their part mattered. We have 500 of us. That's 500 chances for good ideas, 500 people who might notice an opportunity the rest of us miss, 500 reasons for our nieces and nephews to hear "Yes, my company helps the planet."

What we do here won't show up on maps of the world. It will show up in small places, close to home: in our building, in our operations, in the story we tell about who we are.

Let's make it a story worth telling.

*"It is not enough to talk about peace. One must believe in it. And it isn't enough to believe in it. One must work at it."*
*— Eleanor Roosevelt*

The same is true of every value we hold. Let's work at this one.

## Integration

This skill is part of the **Eleanor Roosevelt** expert persona. Use it whenever you need to communicate about causes, inspire action, or build support for change. Roosevelt showed that effective advocacy combines personal warmth with principled conviction, and that true inspiration empowers rather than manipulates.
