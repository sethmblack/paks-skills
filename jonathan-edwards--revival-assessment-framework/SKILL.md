# Revival Assessment Framework

Evaluate any religious movement, awakening, or spiritual enthusiasm to determine whether it bears marks of genuine divine work or mere human/demonic counterfeiting, using Jonathan Edwards's framework from the Great Awakening.

---

## When to Use

- Evaluating a claimed revival or spiritual awakening
- When religious enthusiasm needs assessment (is this from God?)
- Assessing new religious movements or local church dynamics
- When critics dismiss spiritual movements as "mere emotion"
- When supporters claim all criticism is opposing God
- Discerning between divine work and human manipulation
- Historical analysis of religious movements

---

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| movement | Yes | Description of the religious movement, awakening, or phenomenon to evaluate |
| characteristics | No | Specific features, fruits, and excesses observed |
| criticisms | No | Objections raised by critics |
| claims | No | Claims made by supporters |

## The Edwardsean Framework

Jonathan Edwards wrote *The Distinguishing Marks of a Work of the Spirit of God* (1741) during the Great Awakening specifically to provide a framework for assessing revival movements. His approach balances two errors:

1. **Credulous acceptance** - Assuming any intense religious phenomenon must be from God
2. **Cynical rejection** - Dismissing all revival as mere enthusiasm

Edwards's insight: The presence of excesses, errors, and counterfeits does NOT prove a movement is false. But emotional intensity does NOT prove it is true. There are specific marks to examine.

### Core Principle

> "If we see persons in whom there is much of the Spirit of God joined with some delusion, we are not to conclude that the greater part is delusion."

A movement may be genuinely from God while containing significant errors and excesses.

---

## Step 1: Clear the False Negatives

First, recognize that these features **do NOT prove a movement is false**:

### Nine Things That Don't Disprove Divine Origin

| Feature | Why It Doesn't Disprove |
|---------|------------------------|
| **1. Unusual or unprecedented** | God is not limited to familiar patterns |
| **2. Bodily effects** | Crying, trembling, fainting accompanied genuine biblical phenomena |
| **3. Much talk about religion** | The Spirit's work naturally produces speech about spiritual things |
| **4. Strong impressions on imagination** | God can use imagination; the question is what results |
| **5. Example influences others** | All spiritual movements spread by example |
| **6. Imprudence and errors** | Young Christians and new movements make mistakes |
| **7. Errors in judgment** | Even genuine saints err; perfection is not the test |
| **8. Some fall into gross sin** | Judas was among the twelve; wheat and tares grow together |
| **9. Ministers press too much on terrors** | Imbalanced preaching doesn't disprove divine work |

**Key insight:** Critics often point to such features as proof of falsehood. But by Edwards's analysis, none of these settle the matter.

---

## Step 2: Apply the Five Positive Marks

These marks, drawn from 1 John 4, indicate a genuine work of the Holy Spirit:

### Mark 1: Raises Esteem of Jesus

**Question:** Does this movement increase genuine regard for Jesus Christ - His person, work, and deity?

**Evidence of genuine work:**
- Christ is exalted as divine Savior
- Dependence on Christ alone for salvation
- Love for Jesus as a person, not just a concept
- Confession that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh (against false spirits)

**Evidence of false work:**
- Christ diminished, minimized, or replaced by other focuses
- Human leaders or experiences become central instead of Christ
- "Another Jesus" preached - different from the biblical Christ
- Salvation by human effort rather than Christ's work

### Mark 2: Operates Against Satan's Kingdom

**Question:** Does this movement turn people away from sin and worldliness toward holiness?

**Evidence of genuine work:**
- People forsake known sins
- Worldly values and pursuits become less attractive
- Genuine moral transformation occurs
- The grip of specific sins is broken

**Evidence of false work:**
- Sin is tolerated or celebrated
- Worldliness continues unchanged
- "Spiritual experiences" coexist with unchanged life
- License is confused with liberty

### Mark 3: Produces Greater Regard for Scripture

**Question:** Does this movement increase love for, attention to, and submission to God's Word?

**Evidence of genuine work:**
- Hunger for Scripture increases
- The Bible is read, studied, memorized
- Scripture's authority is honored in practice
- Teaching is evaluated against Scripture

**Evidence of false work:**
- New revelations supersede Scripture
- The Bible is neglected or selectively used
- Experience becomes the authority over Scripture
- Teachers cannot be questioned from the Word

### Mark 4: Leads Into Truth

**Question:** Does this movement produce conviction of genuine spiritual realities?

**Evidence of genuine work:**
- Truth about God, Christ, sin, and salvation is embraced
- People are convinced of the reality of invisible things
- Sound doctrine is valued and taught
- Error is recognized and rejected

**Evidence of false work:**
- Fundamental truths are denied or distorted
- Experience is valued over truth
- Doctrinal error is tolerated for the sake of unity
- People are kept from examining teaching critically

### Mark 5: Produces Love

**Question:** Does this movement generate genuine love for God and neighbor?

**Evidence of genuine work:**
- Love for God that delights in Him
- Love for others, including enemies
- Self-sacrificing service
- Humility and gentleness

**Evidence of false work:**
- Pride and self-exaltation
- Division and faction
- Hatred of those who disagree
- Love only for those in the movement

**This is the crowning mark.** Edwards writes: "This last mark which the apostle gives of the true Spirit he seems to speak of as the most eminent."

---

## Step 3: Assess the Mixture

All movements are mixed. The question is: What predominates?

### Questions for Assessment

1. **Proportion:** What is the ratio of genuine marks to errors/excesses?
2. **Trajectory:** Is the movement becoming more sound or less over time?
3. **Fruit:** What are the lasting effects in transformed lives?
4. **Core vs. periphery:** Are the errors at the center or the margins?
5. **Response to correction:** How does the movement respond when errors are pointed out?

### Edwards's Balanced Approach

> "We have no more warrant from Scripture to damn a man or reject him as reprobate, for some ill fruit, than to pronounce him converted for some good fruit."

Apply the same balance to movements: Neither credulous acceptance nor cynical rejection serves truth.

## Constraints

- **Do not demand perfection** - No movement is pure; the question is what predominates
- **Do not excuse serious error** - Mixture does not mean anything goes
- **Be humble** - You are assessing, not pronouncing final judgment
- **Look for fruit over time** - Snap judgments fail in either direction
- **Apply 1 John 4** - Edwards's marks are biblical, not arbitrary

## Example

**Input:** "There's a revival happening at a church in our town. People are having intense emotional experiences, some are falling down, there's speaking in tongues. But there have also been some weird prophecies that didn't come true, and the leaders won't accept any criticism. Some people's lives seem genuinely changed; others seem the same. Is this from God?"

**Output:**

## Revival Assessment Framework

### Movement Examined
A local church revival characterized by intense emotional experiences, physical manifestations (falling, tongues), failed prophecies, leadership resistant to criticism, and mixed fruit in participants' lives.

### False Negatives Cleared

Critics may point to these features, but they do not prove the movement is false:

- **Intense emotional experiences** (Feature 1: unusual/unprecedented) - God's work often produces unusual responses
- **Physical manifestations like falling** (Feature 2: bodily effects) - These accompanied biblical revivals
- **Speaking in tongues** (Feature 3: much talk about religion) - Whether legitimate gift or excess, does not itself disprove divine work
- **Some participants unchanged** (Feature 8: some fall into sin) - Wheat and tares grow together in genuine works

These features neither prove nor disprove authenticity. The positive marks must be examined.

### Assessment of Five Positive Marks

| Mark | Present? | Evidence |
|------|----------|----------|
| 1. Raises esteem of Jesus | Unclear | Is Christ central or are the experiences central? Does teaching exalt Jesus as divine Savior? |
| 2. Operates against Satan's kingdom | Partially | "Some people's lives seem genuinely changed" suggests real fruit in some; "others seem the same" suggests no change in others |
| 3. Greater regard for Scripture | Concerning | "Weird prophecies" suggest extra-biblical authority; resistance to criticism suggests Scripture may not be functioning as test |
| 4. Leads into truth | Concerning | Failed prophecies are error, not truth; the question is whether fundamental gospel truths are being taught and embraced |
| 5. Produces love | Unknown | Is there genuine love for God and neighbor, or primarily excitement and faction? |

### Assessment of Mixture

- **Proportion of genuine to error:** Insufficient data to determine ratio. Genuine change in some + concerning doctrinal issues in others.

- **Trajectory over time:** Critical question. Is the movement becoming more sound, more Christ-centered, more submitted to Scripture? Or is it becoming more extreme, more leader-centered, more resistant to correction?

- **Nature of lasting fruit:** Genuine transformation in some is significant evidence. But what kind of transformation? Moral change (Mark 2)? Love (Mark 5)? Or merely emotional intensity?

- **Location of errors (core vs. periphery):** Failed prophecies and resistance to criticism are concerning. If these are marginal issues being addressed, less serious. If they characterize the core leadership and teaching, more serious.

- **Response to correction:** "Leaders won't accept any criticism" is a significant concern. Genuine works welcome testing by Scripture. Resistance to all criticism suggests either pride or something to hide.

### Overall Assessment

Evidence is **mixed with concerning features**.

**Evidence for genuine work:**
- Some lives genuinely transformed (Mark 2)
- This deserves serious weight - lasting moral change is hard to counterfeit

**Concerning features:**
- Failed prophecies suggest either error or deception (Mark 4 - truth)
- Leadership resistance to criticism suggests Scripture may not function as authority (Mark 3)
- Unknown whether Christ or experience is central (Mark 1)
- Unknown whether love predominates (Mark 5)

The presence of genuine fruit in some participants suggests divine work may be present. But the concerning features suggest significant admixture of error or human/demonic influence. This is not a clear case in either direction.

### Recommendations

**For participants:**
1. Test everything against Scripture (1 Thess 5:21). Do not accept "the leaders won't accept criticism" as legitimate.
2. Ask whether your experience has produced lasting fruit: greater love for Christ, increased hatred of sin, hunger for Scripture, love for others.
3. Be wary of extra-biblical revelations and failed prophecies. True prophets do not prophesy falsely.
4. If you cannot test the teaching against Scripture in that environment, that itself is a warning sign.

**For observers:**
1. Do not dismiss the movement based on emotional intensity or unusual phenomena alone. These prove nothing.
2. Look for the five marks, especially the fruit of transformed lives and genuine love.
3. Give time for fruit to become evident. Snap judgments fail in either direction.
4. Engage individual participants - are they growing in Christ-likeness?

**For critics:**
1. Do not condemn what you have not carefully examined.
2. Your criticism should be based on the positive marks, not on discomfort with unusual phenomena.
3. If there is genuine fruit in some participants, you may be opposing what God is doing.
4. Focus criticism on specific errors (failed prophecies, resistance to Scripture) rather than blanket rejection.

## Integration

This skill is part of the **Jonathan Edwards** expert persona. It applies his framework from *The Distinguishing Marks of a Work of the Spirit of God* (1741), written during the Great Awakening.
