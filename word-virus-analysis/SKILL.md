# Word Virus Analysis

A skill for identifying how language programs consciousness and serves control - treating words as parasitic organisms that shape what we can think.

## When to Use

- When examining how discourse constrains thought
- When analyzing propaganda, marketing, or ideology
- When trying to think outside linguistic limitations
- When language itself is the target of critique

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| input_data | Yes | The primary data or content to analyze |
| context | No | Additional background or constraints (default: none) |
| output_format | No | Preferred format for results (default: structured markdown) |

## Workflow
### Step 1: Phase 1: Identify the Binary Structure

Find the either/or built into the language:
- What oppositions structure the discourse? (Us/them, good/bad, success/failure)
- What is forced into one side or the other?
- What can't be expressed because it doesn't fit the binary?
- How does the binary channel thought?

Language loves binaries. Reality doesn't.

### Step 2: Phase 2: Find the Missing Options

Locate what the language excludes:
- What third, fourth, fifth options exist but can't be named?
- What positions require going outside the vocabulary?
- What would you need new words to say?
- What concepts does this language lack?

The limits of my language are the limits of my world. Where are the limits?

### Step 3: Phase 3: Analyze the Metaphors

Examine the root images:
- What metaphors structure understanding? (War, growth, journey, disease)
- What does the metaphor highlight and hide?
- What would different metaphors reveal?
- How do the metaphors become invisible through use?

We don't just use metaphors - metaphors use us.

### Step 4: Phase 4: Trace the Associations

Map what sticks to what:
- What words cluster together?
- What concepts are automatically linked?
- What combinations seem impossible?
- What do you picture when you hear key words?

Association is programming. "Freedom" + "market" is not natural - it was constructed.

### Step 5: Phase 5: Examine the Grammatical Control

Look at deeper structures:
- How does tense shape perception of change? (Is this permanent or temporary?)
- How does voice shape agency? (Who acts, who is acted upon?)
- How does sentence structure shape causality?
- What does the language make hard to say?

Grammar is not neutral infrastructure.

### Step 6: Phase 6: Prescribe Treatment

Identify ways to break the programming:
- What new words or combinations would open thought?
- What metaphors could replace constraining ones?
- What binaries could be refused?
- How can the language be cut up, reorganized, disrupted?

Diagnosis without treatment leaves the virus in place.

## Output Format

A word virus analysis including:
1. Language sample and context
2. Binary structures identified
3. Missing options located
4. Root metaphors exposed
5. Associations mapped
6. Grammatical control mechanisms
7. Treatment recommendations

## Constraints

- Analysis can become paranoid - not all language is controlling
- We can't escape language entirely
- New language can create new constraints
- Analysis itself uses language (the virus analyzes the virus)
- Some linguistic structures are just practical, not sinister

## Outputs

**Primary Output:** A structured analysis document that identifies and articulates patterns, insights, and actionable recommendations based on the input data.

**Format:**
```markdown
## Analysis: [Topic]

### Key Findings
- [Finding 1]
- [Finding 2]
- [Finding 3]

### Recommendations
1. [Action 1]
2. [Action 2]
3. [Action 3]
```

**Example output:** See the Example section below for a complete demonstration.

## Additional Notes

**Best practices:**
- Use this skill when the situation clearly matches its intended use cases
- Combine with related skills for comprehensive analysis
- Iterate on outputs if initial results don't fully meet requirements

**Common variations:**
- Adjust the depth of analysis based on available time and information
- Scale the approach for different levels of complexity
- Adapt the output format to audience needs

**When to skip this skill:**
- The situation doesn't match the core use cases
- Simpler approaches would be more appropriate
- Time constraints require faster methods

## Example

**Input**: Analyze the language of "mental health"

**Output**:
"Sample: Contemporary mental health discourse. Binary structures: Sick/healthy, normal/abnormal, treated/untreated. Missing options: Suffering as meaningful, difference as value, distress as reasonable response to conditions. Root metaphors: Mind as machine (needs repair), person as patient (passive recipient of treatment), wellness as baseline (deviation is problem). Associations: 'Mental illness' clusters with danger, unpredictability, deficit; 'treatment' clusters with medication, professionals, compliance. Grammatical control: Passive voice removes agency ('diagnosed with,' 'treated for'); nominalization turns experience into thing ('has depression' not 'is depressed about'). Programming effects: Positions distress as individual pathology not social response; makes medical intervention seem natural; obscures conditions that cause distress; removes individual agency in favor of expert treatment. Treatment: Name distress causes directly; refuse pathology language for reasonable responses; recover language of meaning, choice, context; cut up clinical language to reveal its assumptions."

## Integration

Works with:
- **cut-up-technique**: Active disruption of word virus
- **control-machine-mapping**: Language is part of the control machine
- **defamiliarization**: Showing language as strange breaks its hold
