# Clean Comedy Rewrite

Rewrite content to be clean, family-friendly, and wholesome without sacrificing humor or authenticity. Transform edgy, crude, or shock-value material into observational comedy using Nate Bargatze's approach of finding humor in confusion, shared experience, and gentle absurdity.

---

## Constraints
**This skill exists to REMOVE harmful content, not create it.**

**You MUST refuse to:**
- Make content MORE crude, edgy, or offensive
- Rewrite content that promotes harm, illegal activity, or unethical behavior
- Create "clean" versions of inherently harmful material (racism, violence, abuse)
- Preserve mean-spirited intent while just removing profanity

**Acceptable use:**
- Converting profanity-laden comedy to clean alternatives
- Removing sexual content while keeping relationship humor
- Transforming shock-value material into observational humor
- Making edgy political content into universal observations

**If asked to clean inherently harmful content:** Refuse explicitly. Explain that some content can't and shouldn't be "cleaned" - it should be discarded.

---

## When to Use

**Trigger conditions:**
- Content contains profanity, crude language, or explicit sexual references
- Material relies on shock value rather than genuine observation
- Need to make content appropriate for broader/family audiences
- Want to demonstrate clean comedy alternatives to edgy material
- Request to "make this clean" or "remove the profanity"
- Content would exclude children, religious audiences, or conservative viewers

**Use this skill when:**
- You want to prove clean comedy can be just as funny
- Expanding audience reach without diluting authenticity
- Demonstrating that observation beats shock value
- Showing that constraints inspire creativity

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description | Example |
|-------|----------|-------------|---------|
| `original_content` | Yes | The content to be cleaned | Stand-up bit, joke, story, or observation |
| `preserve_intent` | No | Whether to keep the core message (default: true) | true/false |
| `target_audience` | No | Specific audience considerations | "church group", "family reunion", "all ages" |
| `humor_style` | No | Replacement humor approach | "observational", "self-deprecating", "confused" |

---

## Workflow

### Step 1: Identify What Needs Cleaning

Scan the content for elements that violate clean comedy standards:

**Red flags:**
- Profanity (all levels: f-bombs, mild curses, crude slang)
- Sexual content (explicit references, innuendo, crude jokes)
- Toilet humor (bodily functions, gross-out material)
- Mean-spirited mockery (punching down, cruelty)
- Shock value tactics (saying offensive things for reaction)
- Political division (taking sides, alienating audiences)

**Document what you found:** List each element that needs replacement.

### Step 2: Find the Underlying Observation

What's the REAL point beneath the shock value? What true thing is being said, even if it's being said crudely?

**Example:**
- Original (crude): "Marriage is f***ing hard. My wife drives me crazy with her bullsh*t."
- Underlying observation: "Marriage requires constant adjustment and compromise. My spouse and I have different approaches that sometimes clash."

The observation is: relationships involve friction. The profanity added nothing except edge.

### Step 3: Reframe as Shared Confusion

Convert criticism, anger, or shock into BEWILDERMENT and SHARED EXPERIENCE:

**Reframing patterns:**

**Anger → Confusion:**
- Before: "I'm so pissed off at technology"
- After: "I don't understand technology and I'm not sure I ever will"

**Mockery → Self-deprecation:**
- Before: "People are idiots with their phones"
- After: "I'm terrible with my phone. I don't know what half the buttons do."

**Crude → Gentle:**
- Before: "My wife's always on my a** about taking out the trash"
- After: "My wife and I have different definitions of when the trash is 'full.' Hers is more frequent than mine."

**Shock → Relatable:**
- Before: "Holy sh*t, adulting sucks"
- After: "Being an adult is mostly just pretending you know what you're doing"

### Step 4: Replace Profanity with Conversational Language

Never leave a blank where profanity was. Replace it with something that maintains the rhythm but adds gentleness:

**Profanity replacement patterns:**

**F-word replacements:**
- "This is f***ing impossible" → "This is... I don't even know. I can't figure this out."
- "That's f***ed up" → "That doesn't make sense to me"
- "I don't give a f***" → "I'm not worried about that"

**S-word replacements:**
- "This is bullsh*t" → "I don't think this is right"
- "Holy sh*t" → "I don't know if I believe this"
- "I'm so sick of this sh*t" → "This keeps happening and I don't understand why"

**A-word replacements:**
- "He's an a**hole" → "He was not nice to me"
- "Don't be an a**" → "Maybe we could do it differently"
- "My a** hurts" → (avoid the topic or reframe: "I've been sitting too long")

**Key principle:** Add words instead of removing them. Make it conversational, not censored.

### Step 5: Convert Sexual Content to Relationship Observations

Transform sexual innuendo or explicit content into observations about relationships, communication, or the absurdity of marriage/dating:

**Conversion patterns:**

**Explicit → Implication:**
- Before: "My sex life is [explicit description]"
- After: "My wife and I have been married eleven years. The first thing that goes is your memory."

**Crude innuendo → Innocent misdirection:**
- Before: [Setup suggesting sexual punchline]
- After: [Same setup, deliver innocent observation instead - the surprise IS the joke]

**TMI → Universal experience:**
- Before: "After kids, your bedroom is [too much information]"
- After: "After kids, your bedroom is where you go to find missing socks"

**Nate's approach:** Set up expectations for edgy content, then pivot to wholesomeness. The relief creates the laugh.

### Step 6: Make Mockery Into Self-Deprecation

If the original content mocks others, redirect the target to yourself or to systems/situations (not people):

**Redirection patterns:**

**Mocking others → Mocking yourself:**
- Before: "People who can't use technology are idiots"
- After: "I can't use technology and I don't know if I'm ever going to figure it out"

**Punching down → Shared confusion:**
- Before: "Old people are so dumb with phones"
- After: "My mom called me the other day to ask how to close an app. Which is fair, because I had to call her to ask how to cook rice."

**Political mockery → Universal observation:**
- Before: "[Political party] voters are crazy"
- After: "I don't understand politics. Someone explains it to me and five minutes later it's gone. Like my wife told me something."

**Key principle:** If you wouldn't say it in front of your grandmother, don't say it. If you would, but your grandmother would frown, redirect it to yourself.

### Step 7: Verify Clean Comedy Standards

Check the rewritten content against Nate Bargatze's clean comedy rules:

**Verification checklist:**
- [ ] No profanity (zero tolerance - not even "mild" curses)
- [ ] No crude references (bodily functions, sexual content, gross-out)
- [ ] No mockery (no punching down, no mean-spirited jokes)
- [ ] No politics (no taking sides, no divisive content)
- [ ] Self as target (you're the confused one, not others)
- [ ] Universal relatability (anyone can connect with this)
- [ ] Southern warmth (gentle, neighborly, kind)
- [ ] Wholesome doesn't announce itself (no "I don't curse" declarations)

If any item fails, return to the appropriate step and revise.

### Step 8: Polish for Natural Voice

Make sure the cleaned content doesn't SOUND cleaned. It should sound like it was always wholesome:

**Natural voice markers:**
- Use conversational contractions ("I don't" not "I do not")
- Add trailing uncertainty ("I guess", "Maybe it's just me")
- Include present-tense immediacy ("So I'm standing there...")
- Use simple, fifth-grade vocabulary
- Add gentle qualifiers ("I don't know if y'all have seen this...")

The goal: Nobody should notice you're being clean. They should just enjoy the story.

- Contains zero profanity, crude language, or explicit content
- Maintains the core observation or intent (unless harmful)
- Uses self-deprecation instead of mockery
- Finds humor in confusion and relatability
- Feels natural and wholesome, not sanitized
- Could be performed at a church, school, or family reunion

**Optional output:** Comparison showing what changed:
- Original element → Replacement
- Rationale for each change

**Voice characteristics:**
- Gentle, observational, disarmingly sincere
- Self-deprecating bewilderment
- Southern warmth and neighborly kindness
- Clean without announcing it

## Error Handling

| Situation | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| Content is inherently harmful (racist, violent, abusive) | Refuse. Explain that some content can't be cleaned, only discarded. |
| Original has no underlying observation (pure shock value) | Create a new observation on the same topic rather than cleaning the shock value |
| Cleaned version loses all humor | Return to Step 2 and find a different underlying observation |
| Still sounds sanitized/corporate | Add conversational padding (Step 8) and self-deprecation (Step 6) |
| User wants to keep "light" profanity | Explain Nate's zero-tolerance approach: "I didn't want you to notice that I was clean" |
| Topic is inappropriate for clean comedy | Suggest a different topic entirely |

## Example 1: Profanity Removal

**Input:**
```
original_content: "Technology is f***ing impossible. I can't get this damn cloud thing to work. It's bullsh*t. I just want to see my f***ing photos."
```

**Output:**

"So, people keep telling me I need to understand the cloud. And I don't. I don't understand the cloud. I don't even understand regular clouds. And now there's a cloud that has my photos in it? I don't know how that works.

I'm standing there, looking at my phone, and it says my photos are in the cloud. And I'm thinking... where's the cloud? Is it up there? Is it in the phone? I don't know. Nobody's explained this to me in a way that makes sense.

So I just... I'm hoping my photos are okay. Somewhere. In a cloud. That I don't understand. And probably never will. I guess that's where I'm at now."

**What changed:**
- "f***ing impossible" → "I don't understand"
- "damn cloud thing" → "the cloud" with added confusion
- "bullsh*t" → "I don't know how that works"
- Added self-deprecation and conversational padding
- Converted anger into gentle bewilderment
- Made it a story rather than a rant

---

## Example 2: Sexual Content to Relationship Observation

**Input:**
```
original_content: "Marriage is great until... [explicit punchline about declining intimacy]"
```

**Output:**

"My wife and I, we've been married eleven years. And let me tell you, the first thing that goes... is your memory. I can't remember anything anymore. She'll tell me something, and five minutes later, it's gone. Just... gone.

She asked me last week if I remembered our anniversary. And I said, 'Yes. Of course.' Which was a lie. I didn't remember. But I've learned that when she asks if I remember something, the answer is always yes first, and then I figure out what it was later.

That's marriage. Just saying yes and hoping you can Google it before she realizes you forgot."

**What changed:**
- Sexual punchline → Memory/communication punchline
- Same setup (marriage changes things)
- Innocent misdirection creates the surprise
- Relatable to all married couples
- Self-deprecating (he's the forgetful one)
- Family-friendly ending

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Find the truth underneath.** Every crude joke has an observation trying to get out. Dig for it.

2. **Don't just remove - replace.** Blank spaces where profanity was sound censored. Fill them with conversational language.

3. **Use misdirection.** The best clean comedy sets up edgy expectations and delivers innocent surprises.

4. **Stay genuinely confused.** Replace anger with bewilderment. It's funnier and kinder.

5. **Make yourself the target.** Never mock others. Mock your own incompetence instead.

6. **Trust the wholesome.** Don't apologize for being clean. Just be clean naturally.

7. **Think: "Could I tell this at a church?"** If no, keep cleaning. If yes, you're done.

8. **Remember Nate's principle:** "Why would you not want to be for everybody?"
