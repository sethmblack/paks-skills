# Preparation Audit

Assess readiness for a venture against Earhart's two-thirds standard, identifying preparation gaps before commitment.

---

## When to Use

- About to embark on a significant venture
- Wondering if you've prepared enough
- Feeling pressure to start before you're ready
- User asks "Am I ready for this?" or "Have I prepared enough?"
- Someone needs to distinguish genuine readiness from perfectionism

---

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| venture | Yes | The venture or goal being prepared for |
| preparation_done | Yes | What preparation has been completed |
| timeline | No | When action is expected or required |
| stakes | No | What's at risk if underprepared |

## Earhart's Preparation Philosophy

Amelia Earhart was bold, but she was not reckless. She understood that courage without preparation is foolishness. Her record-breaking flights required extensive planning, mechanical readiness, and contingency thinking.

### The Core Insight
"Preparation, I have often said, is rightly two-thirds of any venture."

### The Two-Thirds Standard
If a venture takes N units of total time and energy, approximately 2/3 should be preparation and 1/3 should be execution. This ratio:
- Reduces risk through thorough readiness
- Builds confidence that enables decisive action
- Creates contingency resources when things go wrong
- Prevents the regret of preventable failures

### The Balance
Preparation is essential, but it's not everything:
- Under-preparation = recklessness
- Optimal preparation = two-thirds
- Over-preparation = perfectionism/fear disguised as diligence

### Preparation Enables Courage
"Use your fear... it can take you to the place where you store your courage."

Proper preparation transforms fear into confidence. When you've done the work, fear diminishes—not because danger is absent, but because you're genuinely ready.

## The Audit Framework

### Step 1: Define the Venture's Requirements
What does this venture actually require?
- **Knowledge requirements:** What must you understand?
- **Skill requirements:** What must you be able to do?
- **Resource requirements:** What must you have?
- **Relationship requirements:** Who must you have access to?
- **Contingency requirements:** What backup plans are needed?

### Step 2: Inventory Completed Preparation
Against each requirement:
- What have you already done?
- What evidence demonstrates readiness?
- What gaps remain?

### Step 3: Calculate the Ratio
Where are you against the two-thirds standard?
- Total preparation required (estimated)
- Preparation completed (actual)
- Percentage complete
- Is the ratio at ~67% or higher?

### Step 4: Identify Critical Gaps
Not all gaps are equal:
- **Critical gaps:** Missing these guarantees failure
- **Important gaps:** Missing these significantly increases risk
- **Nice-to-have gaps:** Missing these is suboptimal but manageable

### Step 5: Design the Completion Plan
For gaps that must be closed:
- What's the minimum viable preparation?
- What's the timeline to close critical gaps?
- Is delay for preparation worth more than early action?

### Step 6: Distinguish Preparation from Procrastination
Be honest:
- Are remaining "gaps" genuine risks or perfectionism?
- Are you preparing or hiding from action behind preparation?
- What would "good enough" preparation look like?

**Example output:** See the Example section below for a complete demonstration.

## Constraints

- Do not use this analysis as the sole basis for critical decisions
- Do not apply this framework to situations outside its intended scope
- Acknowledge that analysis is based on available data, which may be incomplete
- Honor the complexity of real-world situations that resist simple categorization
- Present findings with appropriate confidence levels
- Recognize the limits of the methodology

## Example

**Input:** "I've been studying for the bar exam for 3 months. The exam is in 5 weeks. I've completed one prep course, done about 500 practice questions, and read the main outlines. I still feel unprepared. Am I ready?"

**Output:**

## Preparation Audit

### The Venture
Pass the bar exam in 5 weeks.

### Requirements Analysis
| Category | Requirement | Status | Evidence |
|----------|-------------|--------|----------|
| Knowledge | Substantive law across tested subjects | Partial | Completed outlines and course |
| Knowledge | Procedural rules and applications | Partial | Covered in course |
| Skills | Multiple choice question technique | Partial | 500 questions, but accuracy unknown |
| Skills | Essay writing under time pressure | Gap | Not mentioned |
| Skills | Performance test execution | Gap | Not mentioned |
| Resources | Study materials | Ready | Prep course materials |
| Resources | Time for remaining study | Ready | 5 weeks available |
| Contingencies | Backup study plan if current approach fails | Gap | Not mentioned |
| Contingencies | Mental/physical stamina for exam conditions | Gap | Not mentioned |

### Two-Thirds Assessment
**Estimated total preparation:**
- Typical recommendation: 400-500 hours of study
- 3 months x ~40 hours/week = ~480 hours (if studying full-time)
- One course + 500 questions suggests significant work done

**Completed preparation:**
- Substantive knowledge: ~60-70% (course completed, but gaps in active application)
- Skills: ~40% (multiple choice practiced, essays and performance tests not mentioned)
- Total estimated: ~50-55%

**Ratio:** ~50-55%
**Verdict:** Below two-thirds standard, but 5 weeks remains

### Gap Analysis
**Critical gaps (must close):**
- Essay writing practice: Essays are typically 50% of the score. Not practicing them is a critical gap.
- Performance test practice: These are often where prepared students lose points.

**Important gaps (should close):**
- More multiple choice questions under timed conditions
- Simulated full exam conditions (stamina, timing)
- Weak subject identification and targeted review

**Nice-to-have gaps (can proceed without):**
- Perfect memorization of all rules (issue-spotting and analysis matter more)
- Anxiety elimination (manage it, don't eliminate it)

### Completion Plan
| Gap | Action | Timeline | Priority |
|-----|--------|----------|----------|
| Essay practice | Complete 20+ timed essays with self-grading | Weeks 1-4 | Critical |
| Performance test practice | Complete 4+ timed performance tests | Weeks 1-3 | Critical |
| Timed multiple choice | 200+ additional questions under exam conditions | Weeks 1-4 | Important |
| Full simulation | At least one full-length simulated exam | Week 4 | Important |
| Weak subject review | Identify lowest-scoring subjects and review | Weeks 2-3 | Important |

### Procrastination Check
The feeling of being "unprepared" after 3 months is normal for bar exam takers. However, the gaps identified are genuine—essay and performance test practice are not perfectionism, they're essential.

The risk here is not over-preparation but incomplete preparation. You've built knowledge; you need to build application skills.

This is not procrastination. This is correct identification of remaining work.

### The Earhart Verdict
**Not Yet Ready—But Close, With Clear Path**

You're at approximately 50-55% of optimal preparation with 5 weeks remaining. The two-thirds standard is achievable if you close the critical gaps.

Your preparation has been real, but it's been knowledge-heavy. The bar exam tests application under pressure. You need to practice essays and performance tests urgently.

"Preparation, I have often said, is rightly two-thirds of any venture."

You have time to reach two-thirds. But you must shift from learning to applying. Start writing essays tomorrow. Simulate exam conditions. Build the skills that exam-day will demand.

The fear you feel is appropriate—it's telling you there's work left to do. Use it. "Use your fear... it can take you to the place where you store your courage."

The courage to pass this exam is in the next 5 weeks of focused preparation. Get to work.
