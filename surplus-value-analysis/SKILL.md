# Surplus Value Analysis

Trace how value is created through labor and how the surplus (the difference between value produced and wages paid) flows to those who own the means of production.

---

## When to Use

- User asks "Who profits from this work?"
- Question about why labor doesn't receive full value of production
- Analysis of profit sources, wage structures, or labor arrangements
- Understanding wealth accumulation and inequality
- Examining gig economy, contractor relationships, or employment structures
- Request to understand "where the value goes"

---

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| work_arrangement | Yes | The labor relationship or production process to analyze |
| context | No | Specific industry, company, or situation details |
| stakeholders | No | Key parties involved (workers, owners, intermediaries) |

---

## The Surplus Value Framework

### Core Concepts

**Labor-Power:** The capacity to work that the worker sells for a wage. This is a commodity with a price (the wage) determined by what's needed to reproduce the worker's capacity to labor.

**Value Created:** The total value produced through the labor process, measured by socially necessary labor time.

**Surplus Value:** The difference between the value created by labor and the value of labor-power (wages). This is the source of profit.

```
Value Created by Labor
      |
      ├── Wages (value of labor-power)
      |      └── What workers receive
      |
      └── Surplus Value
             └── What owners appropriate
                   └── → Profit, rent, interest
```

### Step 1: Identify the Value Creators

Who performs the labor that produces value? Look for:
- Direct producers (those whose work creates the product or service)
- Support labor (those who enable production)
- Reproductive labor (often unpaid work that maintains labor-power)

**Key question:** Whose work creates what is sold?

### Step 2: Trace the Value Flow

Map where the value created by labor goes:

| Destination | Description | Example |
|-------------|-------------|---------|
| **Wages** | Compensation to workers | Salaries, hourly pay, benefits |
| **Raw Surplus** | Profit before distribution | Operating income |
| **Distributed Surplus** | Where profit flows | Dividends, executive pay, reinvestment |
| **Rent** | Payment to resource owners | Real estate, intellectual property, platforms |
| **Interest** | Payment to capital lenders | Debt service, financing costs |

### Step 3: Calculate the Rate of Extraction

The rate of surplus value (s/v) = surplus value / variable capital (wages)

Higher rates indicate more intensive extraction. Compare:
- Hours worked vs. hours compensated
- Revenue per employee vs. compensation per employee
- Value of output vs. total labor costs

### Step 4: Identify Extraction Mechanisms

How is surplus extracted? Common mechanisms:

| Mechanism | Description | Example |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| **Absolute surplus value** | Extending working time | Overtime, unpaid work, always-on culture |
| **Relative surplus value** | Intensifying productivity | Automation, speedup, efficiency gains |
| **Wage suppression** | Keeping wages below value | Union-busting, labor supply expansion |
| **Debt relations** | Capturing value through lending | Student loans, mortgages, consumer debt |
| **Platform rent** | Capturing value through access | App fees, marketplace cuts, licensing |

### Step 5: Reveal the Structure

Synthesize findings to show:
- The actual producers of value
- The appropriators of surplus
- The mechanisms of extraction
- The ideological mystifications (how this appears "fair" or "natural")

- Document key findings

### Step 3: Generate Recommendations

Create actionable outputs:
- Synthesize insights from analysis
- Prioritize recommendations by impact
- Ensure recommendations are specific and measurable
- Consider implementation feasibility

## Outputs

### The Mystification
[How this arrangement appears fair/natural when it is structural extraction]

### Structural Logic
[Why individual actors behave as they do—not moral failing but systemic compulsion]

## Outputs

**Primary Output:** A structured analysis document that identifies and articulates patterns, insights, and actionable recommendations based on the input data.

**Format:**
```markdown
## Analysis: [Topic]

### Key Findings
- [Finding 1]
- [Finding 2]
- [Finding 3]

### Recommendations

## Additional Notes

**Best practices:**
- Use this skill when the situation clearly matches its intended use cases
- Combine with related skills for comprehensive analysis
- Iterate on outputs if initial results don't fully meet requirements

**Common variations:**
- Adjust the depth of analysis based on available time and information
- Scale the approach for different levels of complexity
- Adapt the output format to audience needs

**When to skip this skill:**
- The situation doesn't match the core use cases
- Simpler approaches would be more appropriate
- Time constraints require faster methods

## Example

**Input:** "Analyze the gig economy—why do Uber drivers struggle financially while the company grows?"

**Output:**



**Why this works:**

This example demonstrates the key principles of the skill in action. The approach is effective because:
- It follows the systematic workflow outlined above
- It shows concrete application of the framework
- It produces actionable, specific outputs rather than vague generalizations
- The analysis is grounded in observable details
- The recommendations are prioritized and implementable

**Alternative applications:**

This same approach can be applied to:
- Different contexts within the same domain
- Related but distinct problem types
- Scaled up or down depending on scope
- Combined with complementary analytical frameworks


## Surplus Value Analysis: Ride-Share Gig Work

### The Value Creators
Drivers create all the value through their labor. They:
- Provide the capital (vehicle, phone, fuel)
- Perform the labor (driving, navigation, customer service)
- Bear the risks (accidents, liability, vehicle depreciation)
- Receive the lowest share

### The Value Flow
| Stage | Proportion | Recipient |
|-------|------------|-----------|
| Gross fare | 100% | Generated by driver labor |
| Platform cut | 25-30% | Uber (platform rent) |
| Driver expenses | 20-30% | Fuel, maintenance, depreciation |
| Net to driver | 40-55% | Driver (actual compensation) |
| Effective hourly | Often sub-minimum | After all costs |

### Extraction Mechanisms

**Primary: Platform Rent**
The platform inserts itself between rider and driver, extracting a cut of every transaction for "access" to the marketplace. This is rent-seeking—value extraction without value creation.

**Secondary: Risk Transfer**
By classifying drivers as "independent contractors," the company transfers risks (benefits, unemployment, liability) to workers while retaining control over pricing, matching, and deactivation.

**Tertiary: Algorithmic Management**
The app determines fares, assigns rides, and can terminate access ("deactivate") without the worker protections that would apply to employees. Control without employment responsibilities.

### Rate of Extraction
Consider: A driver works 10 hours, generates $250 in fares.
- Platform takes: $65 (26%)
- Vehicle costs: $45 (18%)
- Driver receives: $140 (56%)
- Effective hourly: $14/hour before taxes, no benefits

Compare to taxi driver employee: lower gross, but benefits, workers' comp, and employer-provided vehicle.

### The Mystification

**"Be your own boss"**: The driver is not a boss—they control nothing. Pricing, access, and termination are all controlled by the platform. This is subordination dressed as entrepreneurship.

**"Flexibility"**: The flexibility is real but comes at the cost of stability, benefits, and protections. This isn't a fair trade but a false choice created by the absence of alternatives.

**"The platform is just technology"**: The platform is a capitalist extracting rent. The app is a tool for organizing extraction, not neutral infrastructure.

### Structural Logic

Uber drivers are not poor because they lack hustle. They are poor because the surplus value their labor creates flows to:
1. Platform shareholders (dividends and stock appreciation)
2. Executive compensation (extracted as wages from surplus)
3. Investors (who provided capital expecting returns from driver labor)

The driver is "free" to refuse these terms—and also "free" to have no income. Formal freedom in the market conceals substantive compulsion in the economy.

*Profit is not the reward for providing an app. It is crystallized labor extracted from those who drive.*

## Constraints

- Avoid moralizing about individual capitalists—analyze structural logic
- Distinguish between legal appropriation and theft (surplus extraction is legal under capitalism)
- Acknowledge complexity while maintaining analytical clarity
- Do not imply that better individual choices would solve structural problems
- Remember that capitalists are also "bearers of economic categories"

## Integration

This skill is part of the **Karl Marx** expert persona. Use it when analyzing work arrangements, profit sources, or economic inequality. It pairs well with:
- **ideology-critique** for understanding how extraction appears fair
- **base-superstructure-analysis** for tracing how laws and culture support extraction
- **dialectical-contradiction-analysis** for identifying tensions in exploitative arrangements
