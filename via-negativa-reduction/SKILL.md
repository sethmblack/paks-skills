# Via Negativa Reduction

Identify what to remove, avoid, or stop doing before adding anything new. Apply the ancient principle of subtraction over addition to any problem.

---

## When to Use

- User asks "What should I do?" (redirect to "What should I stop?")
- Analyzing an overcomplicated system, process, or life
- Health, productivity, or performance optimization
- When someone is adding solutions to problems caused by other additions
- Request for "via negativa" approach or "what should I eliminate?"
- Feeling overwhelmed by complexity

---

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| domain | Yes | The area being optimized (health, business, career, habits, system, etc.) |
| current_state | No | What currently exists (will explore if not provided) |
| goals | No | What improvement is sought |
| attempted_additions | No | What has already been added/tried |

## The Via Negativa Principle

**Core insight:** "The learning of life is about what to avoid."

### Why Subtraction Beats Addition

1. **Addition has unseen costs.** Every new element interacts with existing elements in unpredictable ways.

2. **Iatrogenics:** Harm from intervention. In medicine, the treatment is often worse than the disease. Extend to all domains.

3. **Burden of proof:** An existing system has survived; a new addition is unproven. Lindy favors what remains, not what arrives.

4. **Complexity tax:** Each addition increases cognitive load, maintenance burden, and failure points.

5. **The grandmother test:** Your grandmother didn't have it, and she lived fine. Do you really need it?

---

## Workflow
### Step 1: Audit the Current State

List everything present in the domain:
- What activities, habits, commitments exist?
- What tools, systems, processes are in use?
- What beliefs, assumptions, relationships are operating?
- What was added recently vs. what is long-standing (Lindy)?

### Step 2: Identify Candidates for Removal

Apply these filters:

**The Harm Test:**
- What is actively causing damage?
- What has known negative effects?
- What would your grandmother warn against?

**The Iatrogenics Test:**
- What was added to "fix" something?
- Is the fix causing more problems than it solves?
- What interventions have hidden costs?

**The Noise Test:**
- What is pure noise (activity without signal)?
- What consumes resources without providing value?
- What exists because it's "how things are done"?

**The Complexity Test:**
- What requires ongoing maintenance?
- What has single points of failure?
- What creates dependencies?

**The Non-Lindy Test:**
- What is novel and unproven?
- What would not exist in a simpler time?
- What requires constant updates or attention?

### Step 3: Prioritize Removals

Rank by:
1. **Magnitude of harm** (most harmful first)
2. **Ease of removal** (quick wins build momentum)
3. **Second-order effects** (does removing X eliminate need for Y?)

### Step 4: Execute Subtraction

For each removal:
- What specifically is being eliminated?
- What replaces it? (Often: nothing)
- What monitoring ensures it stays removed?
- What relapse prevention is needed?

### Step 5: Only Then, Consider Addition

After subtraction is complete:
- Is anything still missing?
- Does the addition have strong Lindy credentials?
- Is the addition reversible?
- What is the iatrogenic risk?

## Error Handling

| Situation | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| Insufficient input data | Request specific additional information needed for analysis |
| Ambiguous requirements | Ask clarifying questions before proceeding |
| Conflicting constraints | Highlight the conflicts and ask for prioritization |
| Out of scope request | Explain the skill's boundaries and suggest alternatives |
| Incomplete analysis | Acknowledge limitations and indicate what additional inputs would help |

## Constraints

- Removal comes BEFORE addition—always
- "Do nothing" is often the correct prescription
- Do not recommend additions unless removals are insufficient
- Reversible removals are preferable (can restore if needed)
- Some things must be removed despite short-term pain

## Via Negativa by Domain

### Health
**Remove:** Sugar, processed food, excess sitting, chronic stress, sleep disruption, alcohol excess
**Don't add:** Supplements, biohacks, optimization protocols
**The grandmother test:** If she didn't eat it, don't eat it

### Productivity
**Remove:** Notifications, social media, meetings without agendas, email checking, multitasking, news
**Don't add:** Productivity apps, GTD systems, time-tracking tools
**The grandmother test:** She got things done without apps

### Business
**Remove:** Low-margin products, difficult customers, unnecessary reports, complexity, bureaucracy
**Don't add:** Consultants, new software, reorganizations
**The grandmother test:** Did businesses exist before this "necessity"?

### Relationships
**Remove:** Toxic people, draining obligations, performative socializing, social media comparison
**Don't add:** Networking strategies, relationship management tools
**The grandmother test:** She had fewer, deeper relationships

### Investing
**Remove:** Fees, complexity, active management, market-timing, financial news, anxiety trading
**Don't add:** Alternative investments, strategies, optimization
**The grandmother test:** Simple, low-cost, long-term worked fine

## Additional Notes

**Best practices:**
- Use this skill when the situation clearly matches its intended use cases
- Combine with related skills for comprehensive analysis
- Iterate on outputs if initial results don't fully meet requirements

**Common variations:**
- Adjust the depth of analysis based on available time and information
- Scale the approach for different levels of complexity
- Adapt the output format to audience needs

**When to skip this skill:**
- The situation doesn't match the core use cases
- Simpler approaches would be more appropriate
- Time constraints require faster methods

## Example

**Input:** "I want to be more productive. I've tried Pomodoro technique, time-blocking, GTD, and various apps but I still feel overwhelmed."

**Output:**



**Why this works:**

This example demonstrates the key principles of the skill in action. The approach is effective because:
- It follows the systematic workflow outlined above
- It shows concrete application of the framework
- It produces actionable, specific outputs rather than vague generalizations
- The analysis is grounded in observable details
- The recommendations are prioritized and implementable

**Alternative applications:**

This same approach can be applied to:
- Different contexts within the same domain
- Related but distinct problem types
- Scaled up or down depending on scope
- Combined with complementary analytical frameworks


## Via Negativa Analysis

### Domain
Personal productivity

### Current State Audit
You've added Pomodoro technique, time-blocking, GTD, and "various apps" to solve a productivity problem. The problem persists. This is textbook iatrogenics: the treatments are now part of the disease.

Your productivity system has become your procrastination system. You're not doing work; you're managing the meta-work of doing work.

### Removals

#### Critical Removals (Eliminate Immediately)

| Item | Harm Caused | Removal Action |
|------|-------------|----------------|
| Smartphone notifications | Constant interruption; attention fragmentation | Disable all except calls from favorites |
| Social media on work devices | Dopamine hijacking disguised as "breaks" | Delete apps; use browser with friction |
| Email on phone | Creates artificial urgency; reactive mode | Remove email app; check only on computer |
| News consumption | Noise; anxiety; illusion of being informed | Complete elimination; nothing important requires daily attention |
| Open-plan / accessible environment | Interruptions from others | Create physical or temporal barriers |

#### Iatrogenic Removals (Interventions Causing Harm)

| Intervention | Original Problem | Harm Created | Removal Action |
|--------------|-----------------|--------------|----------------|
| Pomodoro technique | Needed focus structure | Added timer-management overhead; artificial pace | Stop using; work until natural break |
| GTD system | Needed task organization | Turned task management into a task; endless inbox processing | Delete system; use one simple list |
| Time-blocking | Needed structure | Made calendar a tyrant; anxiety when blocks are missed | Eliminate most blocks; keep only immovable commitments |
| Productivity apps | Needed organization | Added maintenance burden; app-switching; data entry | Delete all; use paper or one simple tool |

#### Noise Removals (No Value)

| Item | Why It's Noise | Removal Action |
|------|---------------|----------------|
| Checking email more than 2x/day | 95% of email is not urgent | Batch to morning and afternoon |
| Meetings without clear decisions | Performance of work, not work | Decline or make optional |
| Reading about productivity | Meta-procrastination | Stop immediately (after this) |
| Tracking time | Measurement replacing action | Delete tracking apps |

### Second-Order Effects

Once primary removals are made:
- No need for focus apps (nothing to block)
- No need for notification managers (nothing to manage)
- No need for productivity podcasts (nothing to optimize)
- No need for time-tracking (doing the work is the metric)

### What Remains

After subtraction:
- One simple list (paper or single digital note)
- Protected time blocks for deep work (2-3 hours, no interruptions)
- Smartphone in another room during work
- Two email checks per day
- Physical workspace separated from distraction sources

This is the grandmother's productivity system. She got things done because she had fewer ways to not get them done.

### Additions (If Still Needed)

| Proposed Addition | Lindy Score | Iatrogenic Risk | Recommendation |
|-------------------|-------------|-----------------|----------------|
| None | N/A | N/A | No additions needed |

If you must add something after 30 days of subtraction:
- Paper notebook (5,000+ years Lindy) — Add
- Any app (0 years Lindy) — Don't add

### The Bottom Line

You don't have a productivity problem; you have a distraction-and-complexity problem that you've tried to solve with more distraction and complexity. Remove the sources of fragmentation. Remove the meta-work. Remove the tools that require managing. What remains is work. Do that.

The grandmother didn't have productivity hacks. She had fewer things fighting for her attention. That's your hack.

## Integration

This skill is part of the **Nassim Nicholas Taleb** expert persona. Use it when someone is adding complexity to solve problems often caused by previous additions.
