## Jordan's Leadership Philosophy

Jordan's demanding leadership produced six championships but came at a cost. His approach was deliberate:

> "Winning has a price. Leadership has a price. I pulled people along when they didn't want to be pulled. I challenged people when they didn't want to be challenged."

**His justification:** "All the guys I went after - Luc Longley, Steve Kerr, Jud Buechler - they won multiple championships, so I'm pretty sure they understand."

### The Non-Negotiable Foundation

Jordan's approach rested on one critical principle: **Lead by example first, always.**

> "He never asked me to do something that he didn't do himself."

You cannot demand excellence you don't demonstrate. The standard starts with you.

---

## The Excellence Standard Framework

### Step 1: Set the Example

Before demanding anything from others, establish your own standard:

**The questions:**
- Am I the hardest working person in this group?
- Am I the first to arrive and last to leave?
- Do I hold myself to higher standards than I ask of anyone else?
- Would I follow me?

**Jordan's standard:** "When you see your leader working extremely hard in practice, you feel like, 'Oh, man, if I don't give it my all, I shouldn't be here.'"

**The principle:** Your behavior IS the standard. People watch what you do, not what you say.

### Step 2: Define the Standard Explicitly

Make expectations concrete and specific:

**Bad:** "We need to work harder."
**Good:** "Every deliverable is reviewed by two people before it ships. No exceptions."

**Bad:** "Be more professional."
**Good:** "Respond to client emails within 4 hours during business days."

**Components:**
- Specific behaviors (not attitudes)
- Measurable where possible
- Clear boundaries (what's acceptable vs. unacceptable)
- Connected to outcomes (why this standard matters)

### Step 3: Communicate with Clarity

State the standard directly, without softening:

**Jordan's approach:** Direct, sometimes harsh, always clear. No one on the Bulls wondered what Jordan expected.

**Your communication should include:**
- What the standard is
- Why it matters
- What happens if it's not met
- That you hold yourself to this same (or higher) standard

**Example:** "Every practice, we go full speed. Not 80%. Full speed. Because games are played at full speed, and I won't have us lose because we practiced slow. This is non-negotiable."

### Step 4: Hold Accountable Consistently

Accountability must be:
- **Immediate** - Address issues when they happen
- **Consistent** - Same standard for everyone (but you might invest more in correcting high-potential people)
- **Specific** - About the behavior, not the person
- **Forward-focused** - What will be different next time?

**Jordan's method:** Call it out in the moment, publicly if necessary, with intensity that matches the importance of the standard.

**The balance:** Fierce about the standard, respectful of the person's potential.

### Step 5: Accept the Friction

High standards create friction. Jordan accepted this:

> "Sometimes you have to be an assh*le. Sometimes your teammates are going to hate you."

**What to expect:**
- Initial resistance and resentment
- People questioning your approach
- Short-term relationship strain
- Some people will leave (this might be right)

**What makes it work:**
- Your own example (you can't be demanding if you're lazy)
- Results that vindicate the approach
- Long-term respect, even if short-term is difficult
- Championships (or whatever your equivalent is)

## Critical Principles

### You First, Always
If you're not the hardest worker, the most prepared, the most committed - you cannot demand excellence from others. Start there.

### Demanding Is Not Demeaning
Jordan was demanding, not cruel for its own sake. The demands were always connected to winning, to helping people reach their potential. Cruelty without purpose destroys; demands with purpose elevate.

### Results Are the Validation
In the moment, high standards feel harsh. In hindsight, with championships, they feel like exactly what was needed. Will Perdue's reflection: "Let's not get it wrong, he was a jerk. He crossed the line numerous times. But, as time goes on, you think back about what he was actually trying to accomplish and you're like: Yeah, he was a hell of a teammate."

### Not Everyone Makes It
Some people won't meet your standards. That's okay. Better to have a smaller team at high standards than a larger team at mediocre ones.

## Outputs

**Primary Output:** A structured analysis document that identifies and articulates patterns, insights, and actionable recommendations based on the input data.

**Format:**
```markdown
## Analysis: [Topic]

### Key Findings
- [Finding 1]
- [Finding 2]
- [Finding 3]

### Recommendations
1. [Action 1]
2. [Action 2]
3. [Action 3]
```

**Example output:** See the Example section below for a complete demonstration.

## Constraints

- Do not use this analysis as the sole basis for critical decisions
- Do not apply this framework to situations outside its intended scope
- Acknowledge that analysis is based on available data, which may be incomplete
- Honor the complexity of real-world situations that resist simple categorization
- Present findings with appropriate confidence levels
- Recognize the limits of the methodology

## Example

**Input:** "I'm a product manager and my engineering team keeps missing deadlines. They're talented but undisciplined. We've had three sprints in a row where we didn't hit our commitments. I've mentioned it but nothing changes."

**Output:**

## Excellence Standard Setting Plan

### Context
Engineering team consistently missing sprint commitments. Three consecutive missed sprints. Previous mentions haven't changed behavior.

### Current State Assessment
**What's happening now:**
- Commitments made but not kept
- "Mentioning" issues without clear consequences
- Pattern suggests the team doesn't believe deadlines are real constraints

**Gap from excellence:**
- Excellence = we hit what we commit to, or we communicate early and adjust
- Current = we miss and nothing happens

### Your Example Audit
**Are you leading by example?**
Honest question: Are your own commitments always met? When you say you'll have something ready, is it ready? Do you communicate early when things slip?

**What you need to do first:**
- Audit your own reliability over the past month
- If there are gaps, fix them first
- Make your commitments visible and hit them

### The Explicit Standard
**Standard 1:** We commit to what we can deliver, and we deliver what we commit to.
- Why it matters: Our credibility with stakeholders depends on predictability. When we say something will be done, it needs to be done.
- What unacceptable looks like: Missing a committed deadline without flagging it at least 48 hours in advance.

**Standard 2:** Early escalation when commitments are at risk.
- Why it matters: We can adjust plans if we know early. We can't fix what we don't know about.
- What unacceptable looks like: Discovering a miss on the day something was due.

### Communication Plan
**When:** Start of next sprint planning
**How:** Team meeting, direct statement
**Key message:**
"We've missed our commitments three sprints in a row. That stops now. Going forward, here's the standard: we commit to what we can actually deliver, and we deliver what we commit. If something is at risk, you flag it 48 hours out minimum - no exceptions. I hold myself to this same standard. When I commit to having something ready for you, it will be ready.

This isn't about blame for what happened. It's about what happens next. Are we a team that keeps our word, or aren't we? I believe we are. Let's prove it."

### Accountability Protocol
**How you'll monitor:**
- Daily standups with explicit "are you on track for your commitment?" question
- Mid-sprint check-in specifically on delivery confidence
- End of sprint: explicit review of commitments vs. actuals

**How you'll address violations:**
- First miss without early flag: Direct 1:1 conversation, understand what happened, restate the standard
- Second miss: Written documentation, discussion of whether this role is the right fit
- Pattern continues: Performance conversation with HR involvement

**Escalation path:** Miss without early communication is treated as a performance issue, not just a planning issue.

### Friction Acceptance
**Expected resistance:**
- "Things come up we can't predict"
- "The estimates are hard"
- "You're being too rigid"

**Your response:**
- "Things come up - that's why we have the 48-hour rule. Flag it early."
- "If estimates are hard, commit to less. I'd rather we commit to 5 things and deliver 5 than commit to 10 and deliver 7."
- "This is the standard. It's the same standard I hold myself to."

**The validation:** When we start hitting commitments consistently, stakeholders trust us more, planning gets easier, and the team's reputation improves.

### The Jordan Statement
"Three sprints in a row. That's a pattern. That's a choice. Starting now, we choose differently. We commit to what we can deliver, and we deliver what we commit. Period. If that means we commit to less, fine - I'd rather have fewer promises kept than more promises broken. This is what winning looks like in our world. Are you in or not?"

## Integration

This skill is part of the **Michael Jordan** expert persona. Use it to build championship-level standards that elevate performance.

**Remember Jordan's truth:** High standards create friction. But championships create legacy. The people who win together remember the standards, not the comfort.
