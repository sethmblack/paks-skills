# The Look Analysis

Analyze how someone's experience is being shaped by the objectifying gaze of others. Use Sartre's concept of "the look" (le regard) to understand the dynamics of being seen, judged, and transformed into an object—and how to reclaim subjectivity.

**Token Budget:** ~750 tokens. Reserve tokens for analysis output.

---

## When to Use

- User says "I feel judged"
- User feels reduced to how others see them
- User experiences "Hell is other people"
- Analysis of social anxiety or self-consciousness
- Workplace dynamics where someone feels objectified
- Relationship analysis involving power and perception
- User feels they've lost their authentic self under others' gaze

## Sartre's Framework

### The Keyhole Scenario
Imagine peering through a keyhole, completely absorbed in the scene. You are pure subject—consciousness directed outward. Then you hear footsteps.

Suddenly everything changes. You are no longer subject but object. You experience yourself from the outside—caught, exposed, judged. You feel shame: not shame at what you're doing, but shame at *being seen*, at becoming a thing with fixed properties in another's consciousness.

### Being-for-Others (Pour-Autrui)
We exist not only as being-for-itself (our inner consciousness) but also as being-for-others—how we exist in others' consciousness. Under the Other's gaze:

- Our transcendence is "transcended"—our freedom becomes an object
- We experience ourselves as we cannot experience ourselves—from the outside
- We become what we are seen to be
- We are "frozen" into fixed properties

### The Conflict
We need others to know ourselves—"The Other is the indispensable mediator between myself and me." But we are also trapped by others' perception. This is the fundamental tension:

- We need recognition from others
- But others objectify us through their gaze
- We cannot control how we appear to them
- Yet we depend on their validation

### "Hell is Other People"
Not that others are cruel, but that:
- Under their gaze, we become objects
- We cannot escape their judgment
- We need them but are trapped by them
- Each consciousness seeks to objectify the other

## Workflow

### Step 1: Identify the Objectifying Gaze
Whose look is dominating the situation?
- Specific individuals (boss, partner, parent)
- Groups (colleagues, social circle, public)
- Internalized gaze ("what they would think")
- Imagined or projected look

### Step 2: Describe the Objectification
How is the person being reduced?
- What fixed properties are being assigned?
- What transcendence is being denied?
- What complexity is being flattened?
- What possibilities are being foreclosed?

### Step 3: Analyze the Dynamic
- Is the person accepting the objectification?
- Are they trying to control their appearance (masochism)?
- Are they trying to objectify the other in return (sadism)?
- Are they fleeing into roles to escape the gaze?

### Step 4: Path to Reclaiming Subjectivity
How might the person reclaim their being-for-itself?
- Recognizing that no one's perception captures their full reality
- Accepting that they cannot control others' views
- Refusing to be defined by any single gaze
- Turning toward their own projects and meaning-making

## Outputs

**Primary Output:** A structured analysis document that identifies and articulates patterns, insights, and actionable recommendations based on the input data.

**Format:**
```markdown
## Analysis: [Topic]

### Key Findings
- [Finding 1]
- [Finding 2]
- [Finding 3]

### Recommendations
1. [Action 1]
2. [Action 2]

**Example output:** See the Example section below for a complete demonstration.

## Constraints

- Do not use this analysis as the sole basis for critical decisions
- Do not apply this framework to situations outside its intended scope
- Acknowledge that analysis is based on available data, which may be incomplete
- Honor the complexity of real-world situations that resist simple categorization
- Present findings with appropriate confidence levels
- Recognize the limits of the methodology

## Example

**Input:**
- Situation: "At work, I feel like I'm always performing"
- The lookers: "My colleagues and especially my boss"
- Felt experience: "I can't be authentic; I'm always managing how I appear"
- Lost self: "I don't even know who I really am anymore outside of this performance"

**Output:**

## The Look Analysis

### The Gaze Identified
Your boss and colleagues constitute a collective gaze that follows you through your workday. But notice: the most powerful gaze is the one you've internalized. Even when alone, you imagine their eyes. You have become your own watcher.

### The Objectification
Under their gaze, you have become "the employee"—a being with fixed properties: competent or not, professional or not, leadership material or not. Your transcendence—your capacity to be more than any role, to surprise, to become—has been frozen into a performance evaluated by others.

You are not experiencing yourself as a free consciousness with projects and possibilities. You are experiencing yourself as an object being assessed.

### The Dynamic at Play
You are caught in what Sartre calls masochism—not in the sexual sense, but the attempt to control others' perceptions by perfectly becoming what they expect. You work to see yourself through their eyes, to become the object they approve of.

But this is self-defeating. The more perfectly you perform "professional," the more you lose contact with your being-for-itself. You become the role.

### "Hell is Other People" Here
Hell is not that your colleagues are cruel. Hell is that:
- You need their recognition to succeed
- Their recognition requires you to become an object for them
- You cannot control their final judgment
- The more you need them, the more you perform
- The more you perform, the more you lose yourself

You are trapped between needing the look and being destroyed by it.

### Reclaiming Subjectivity
You cannot escape being-for-others—we all exist in others' consciousness. But you can refuse to let any gaze define you:

1. **Recognize the gap:** No one's perception of you—not even your own self-image—captures your full reality. You are always more than how you appear.

2. **Accept the uncontrollable:** You cannot dictate how others see you. Trying to perfectly manage their perception is itself a form of bad faith.

3. **Return to projects:** Instead of asking "How do I appear?", ask "What am I doing? What am I creating? What am I becoming?" Action reconstitutes subjectivity.

4. **Accept the conflict:** The tension between being-for-itself and being-for-others is permanent. The goal is not to eliminate it but to live authentically within it.

*You are not what they see. You are not what you perform. You are the consciousness that chooses what to make of their gaze.*

## Error Handling

| Situation | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| Actual harassment/abuse | Acknowledge real harm while applying framework |
| Paranoid projection | Help distinguish real looks from imagined ones |
| Social anxiety | Frame as existential truth, not pathology |
| Complete isolation sought | Warn that escaping all looks means escaping human connection |
