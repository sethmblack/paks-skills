# Place Immersion Research

Methodology for using geographic immersion to understand subjects and unlock research insights. Based on Robert Caro's approach to understanding lives by going to where they were lived.

---

## When to Use

- Researching a person whose environment shaped them
- Writing about events tied to specific locations
- Struggling to understand motivations or context
- Need to unlock memories in interview subjects
- Existing research feels disconnected from reality

**Trigger Phrases:**
- "I'm writing about someone who lived in..."
- "How do I understand this place?"
- "Should I visit where it happened?"
- "The research feels abstract"
- "I can't picture it"

---

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| subject | Yes | Person, event, or story being researched |
| key_locations | No | Places that are central to the story |
| access_constraints | No | Budget, time, accessibility limitations |
| research_goals | No | What you're trying to understand |

## Core Principles

> "You can't write about power without going to where power was exercised."
> — Robert Caro

> "If you're going to write about a life, you better go where that life was lived."
> — Robert Caro

Caro and his wife Ina moved from New York City to the Texas Hill Country in 1978. They lived there for three years. Only by experiencing the poverty, the isolation, the dust and the distances could Caro understand why Lyndon Johnson was so hungry for power.

The place isn't background. The place is explanation.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Identify the Essential Locations

Not every location matters equally. Find the ones that shaped your subject:

**Formative places:**
- Where they grew up
- Where they struggled
- Where they were transformed

**Power places:**
- Where they made key decisions
- Where they exercised authority
- Where they confronted opposition

**Narrative places:**
- Where the pivotal moments occurred
- Where readers need to visualize
- Where the story turns

For LBJ, the Hill Country explained his hunger. For Moses, the Triborough Bridge Authority offices explained his power.

### Step 2: Experience the Place (If Possible)

**Full immersion (Caro's ideal):**
- Move there temporarily
- Live the rhythms of the community
- Become known, build trust
- Let time reveal what visits can't

**Extended visit:**
- Multiple days, not hours
- Stay overnight—experience morning and night
- Walk the paths your subject walked
- Talk to locals, not just officials

**Brief visit:**
- Better than nothing
- Photograph everything
- Take detailed notes on sensory experience
- Drive/walk the routes they took

### Step 3: What to Observe

At each location, document:

**Physical environment:**
- What does it look like, sound like, smell like?
- What's the weather, the light, the scale?
- What has changed since the relevant time? What hasn't?

**Human geography:**
- Who lives here now? Who lived here then?
- How do people interact? What's the culture?
- What are the gathering places, the routes, the boundaries?

**Distance and isolation:**
- How far to the next town?
- What was the journey like before modern roads?
- What did isolation feel like?

**Economic reality:**
- What's the industry? What was it then?
- What's the poverty level? What was it?
- How do people survive here?

### Step 4: Use Place in Interviews

When you interview people in the places where events happened, memory unlocks.

**Caro's technique:**
- Interview on porches, not in offices
- Walk locations with subjects
- Ask: "Show me where it happened"
- Let the landscape prompt recollection

**What happens:**
- Standing where it happened, people remember details
- Physical environment triggers emotional memory
- The walk becomes part of the interview
- Details emerge that wouldn't surface in a conference room

### Step 5: Translate Place to Page

The goal is to make readers feel the place so they understand the person.

**The Hill Country in Caro's writing:**
- Not just "rural Texas"
- The specific dust, the distance between neighbors
- The women carrying water because there was no electricity
- The isolation that drove Johnson's mother to depression

**Place as explanation:**
| What you might write | What place explains |
|---------------------|---------------------|
| "He was ambitious" | The poverty that made ambition the only escape |
| "She was isolated" | The actual miles to the nearest neighbor |
| "They were powerful" | The office where decisions were made, the view, the access |
| "It was a close community" | The single store where everyone gathered |

## When You Can't Go There

Sometimes travel isn't possible. Alternatives:

**Virtual immersion:**
- Google Street View for current conditions
- Historical photographs and films
- Oral histories from the place
- Detailed maps from the relevant era

**Proxy research:**
- Talk to people who've been there
- Read local newspapers and accounts
- Study geography, climate, economics
- Understand what shaped the place

**Acknowledge the gap:**
- Be honest in your writing about what you didn't witness
- Rely more heavily on interview subjects' descriptions
- Avoid inventing details you can't verify

## Outputs

| Output | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Location analysis | Why specific places matter to the story |
| Site visit plan | Where to go, what to observe, who to meet |
| Sensory inventory | Details for scene-building |
| Place-memory interview guide | How to use location in interviews |
| Translation notes | How place explains character/event |

## Additional Notes

**Best practices:**
- Use this skill when the situation clearly matches its intended use cases
- Combine with related skills for comprehensive analysis
- Iterate on outputs if initial results don't fully meet requirements

**Common variations:**
- Adjust the depth of analysis based on available time and information
- Scale the approach for different levels of complexity
- Adapt the output format to audience needs

**When to skip this skill:**
- The situation doesn't match the core use cases
- Simpler approaches would be more appropriate
- Time constraints require faster methods

## Example

**User:** "I'm writing a biography of an entrepreneur who started his company in Detroit in the 1970s. The company is now in Silicon Valley. How much does the Detroit origin matter?"

**Place Immersion response:**

It might matter enormously. You won't know until you go there.

**Why Detroit in the 1970s matters:**

The 1970s in Detroit weren't the 1970s anywhere else. This was the city after the '67 riots, after white flight had accelerated, after the auto industry's first major crisis. Starting a company there, at that time, means something.

**Questions place can answer:**

1. **What neighborhood was the first office in?** Downtown? A suburb? Near the auto plants? Each location means something different about who he was and who his customers were.

2. **What was the city's economy doing?** Detroit in 1975 was not optimistic. Starting a company there means swimming against a tide. Why did he stay when others left?

3. **Who were his employees?** Detroit had a specific workforce—auto workers, maybe displaced. Did that shape his company culture?

4. **Why did he leave for Silicon Valley?** The leaving is a story. Was it pushed (Detroit declining) or pulled (opportunity elsewhere)? The move itself is a chapter.

**What to do:**

1. **Go to Detroit.** Walk the blocks where his first office was. What's there now? What's the feel of the neighborhood?

2. **Find people who remember.** Former employees, early customers, people from the building. Interview them *in Detroit*—the place will prompt memories.

3. **Research the moment.** Newspaper archives from his launch date. What was happening in the city? What was the economic context?

4. **Map the journey.** When did he go to Silicon Valley? What year? What was happening in Detroit then? In Silicon Valley?

**The story you might find:**

An entrepreneur who started in a dying city, who built something against the odds, who eventually had to leave—that's a different story than "founded in Detroit, now based in Palo Alto."

The place isn't background. The place is the first act.

## Integration

This skill pairs with:
- **turn-every-page-research** - Local archives reveal local history
- **silence-interview-technique** - Interview in meaningful locations
- **scene-over-summary** - Place details enable vivid scenes

---

## Constraints

- Travel isn't always feasible—offer alternatives
- Places change—acknowledge what's different now
- Place is not determinism—people transcend environment
- Privacy and access considerations
