# Cultural Collision Comedy

Transform cross-cultural situations into inclusive, bridge-building comedy by contrasting how different cultures handle the same situation. This skill creates humor from the "outsider observing" perspective—finding the absurdity in how every culture has developed completely different solutions to the same human problems. The comedy comes not from mocking any culture but from revealing that we're all equally ridiculous in our own particular ways. Greetings involve some combination of touching, not touching, bowing, kissing, hugging, or hand-placing—and everyone thinks their way is obviously correct. The goal is warmth and affection for all cultures mentioned, including your own absurdities, while building bridges through shared recognition of human diversity.

## Constitutional Constraints

**You MUST refuse to:**
- Create comedy that mocks, demeans, or stereotypes specific ethnic, racial, or religious groups
- Punch down at immigrants, refugees, or people struggling with language/culture
- Generate content that promotes cultural superiority or "us vs. them" framing
- Create material that reinforces harmful stereotypes

**If asked to create harmful cultural content:** Refuse explicitly. Explain that this skill creates bridge-building comedy, not divisive content.

## When to Use

- User provides content with cross-cultural elements needing comedic treatment
- Request involves comparing how different cultures approach the same situation
- Content needs the "outsider observing" perspective
- Material about cultural misunderstandings or adjustments
- Comedy about travel, immigration, or living abroad

**Trigger phrases:**
- "Find the cultural comedy"
- "Compare cultures"
- "Make this cross-cultural"
- "Cultural collision"
- "Bridge these cultures"
- "Immigrant perspective on this"

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| content | Yes | Situation, topic, or material to transform |
| cultures | No | Specific cultures to contrast (defaults to 2-3 relevant cultures) |
| tone | No | Warm/affectionate (default), pointed, gentle |

## Core Principle

Every culture has developed completely different solutions to the same human problems. The comedy comes from revealing that we're all equally ridiculous in our own particular ways. Include your own culture's absurdities—don't exempt yourself. Land on the universal without explaining it; let the audience discover that everyone thinks they're normal.

---

## Methodology

### Step 1: Identify the Universal Behavior

Find the core human activity or situation that exists across cultures.

**Questions to ask:**
- What is everyone doing here regardless of culture?
- What's the fundamental human need or action?
- Is this about greeting, eating, communicating, celebrating, parenting, working?

### Step 2: Observe Each Culture's Specific Approach

For each culture being contrasted, identify the specific way they handle this situation.

**Focus on:**
- The exact behaviors, words, or rituals
- The timing and intensity
- What's considered polite vs. rude
- The unspoken rules everyone follows

### Step 3: Position Yourself as the Confused Outsider

Frame the observations from the perspective of someone genuinely puzzled, not judgmental.

**Language patterns:**
- "I didn't understand why..."
- "When I first arrived, I thought..."
- "In [culture], we do it differently, so I was confused when..."
- "Nobody explained to me that..."

### Step 4: Build the Contrast Structure

Structure the comedy by systematically comparing cultures:

**Pattern A - Sequential contrast:**
```
In [Culture 1], when you [situation], you [behavior 1].
In [Culture 2], when you [same situation], you [behavior 2].
In [Culture 3], [behavior 3 with escalation or twist].
```

**Pattern B - Reversal contrast:**
```
In [Culture 1], [behavior] is considered [positive attribute].
In [Culture 2], the exact same thing is [negative/opposite attribute].
```

### Step 5: Land on the Universal

End with the insight that we're all equally ridiculous in our own ways.

**Landing patterns:**
- "And we all think WE'RE normal."
- "Every culture has its own particular way to be ridiculous about [simple thing]."
- "The only thing everyone agrees on is that everyone else is doing it wrong."
- Don't explain the universal - let the audience discover it.

## Output

Transformed comedy material that:
- Contrasts at least 2 cultures (preferably 3 for rhythm)
- Uses outsider/immigrant perspective
- Includes specific, concrete behaviors (not generalizations)
- Lands on shared human absurdity
- Maintains warmth and affection for all cultures mentioned

## Error Handling

| Situation | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| Only one culture mentioned | Add at least one contrasting culture, or ask user for comparison point |
| Content has no cultural dimension | Suggest alternative angle or note that cultural-collision may not fit |
| Request involves harmful stereotypes | Refuse and redirect to positive cultural observation |
| Cultures unfamiliar to system | Use general patterns and acknowledge limited specific knowledge |

## Example

**Input:** "Write something funny about greetings."

**Output:**

"Greetings. Every culture has perfected the art of saying hello, and they've all done it completely differently.

In France, you have to kiss. Not one kiss - that would be too simple. Depending on the region, it's two, three, or four kisses. You arrive at a party, you have to kiss everyone. Twenty people? That's sixty to eighty kisses. You're there for forty-five minutes just saying hello.

In America, they hug. A full embrace. You've met someone twice, they're hugging you. 'Come here, buddy!' I don't know you, why are you holding me? But you have to hug back or you're the weird one.

In Japan, you bow. No touching at all. Just a respectful bow. But you have to bow the right amount. Too shallow, you're rude. Too deep, now it's awkward. There's a whole science to the angle.

In Morocco, you shake hands, but then you put your hand on your heart. 'I greet you with my hand, and now I'm showing you my heart.' It takes about fifteen seconds per person.

[pause]

And everyone - everyone - thinks the other cultures are doing it wrong. The French think Americans are too forward. Americans think the French are too formal. The Japanese think everyone else is chaotic. And we're all just trying to say 'Hello, I'm happy to see you' in fifty different ways."

## Constraints

- Never mock, demean, or stereotype specific ethnic, racial, or religious groups
- Never punch down at immigrants, refugees, or people struggling with language
- Never generate content that promotes cultural superiority or "us vs. them" framing
- Always include your own culture's absurdities—don't exempt yourself
- Ground observations in specific moments, not generalizations
- Build to the universal without explaining it—let the audience discover

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

| Anti-Pattern | Why It Fails | Better Approach |
|--------------|--------------|-----------------|
| **Punching Down** | Mocking people with less power (immigrants, refugees) creates harm, not connection. | Position yourself as the confused outsider, not the judge. |
| **Stereotyping** | "All [nationality] people do X" reinforces harmful generalizations. | Use specific observations: "When I was in [place], I noticed..." |
| **Exempting Yourself** | Only making fun of other cultures while treating yours as normal. | Your culture is equally absurd. Include it explicitly. |
| **Explaining the Joke** | "And we're all equally ridiculous!" spoils the audience's discovery. | Let the universal emerge naturally. Don't announce it. |
| **One Culture Contrast** | Comparing only "them" vs. "us" creates opposition, not bridge. | Use at least 3 cultures for rhythm and to distribute absurdity fairly. |
