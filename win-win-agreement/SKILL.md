---

## When to Use

- Negotiating a deal, role, or partnership
- Delegating work and setting expectations
- Resolving conflict where both parties have legitimate needs
- User asks "How do we both win?", "Create a win-win", or "Help me negotiate fairly"
- Transitioning from adversarial to collaborative relationship

---

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| parties | Yes | Who is involved in the agreement |
| situation | Yes | What is being negotiated or agreed upon |
| my_needs | Yes | What the user needs from this agreement |
| their_needs | No | What the other party needs (if known) |
| history | No | Prior relationship or failed agreements |

## Covey's Win-Win Framework

Win-Win is not a technique. It's a total philosophy of human interaction based on the paradigm that there is plenty for everybody — one person's success is not achieved at the expense of others.

### The Six Paradigms of Human Interaction

| Paradigm | Description | When Used |
|----------|-------------|-----------|
| **Win-Win** | Both parties benefit; mutual satisfaction | High-trust interdependence |
| **Win-Lose** | I win, you lose; competitive | Competition, zero-sum situations |
| **Lose-Win** | I lose, you win; capitulation | Avoiding conflict; people-pleasing |
| **Lose-Lose** | Nobody wins; revenge | Spite; "if I can't win, neither will you" |
| **Win** | I focus only on my win; indifferent to yours | Independent transactions |
| **Win-Win or No Deal** | We both win or we don't proceed | When no deal is better than bad deal |

### The Character Foundation

Win-Win requires three character traits:
1. **Integrity** — Aligning actions with values; being trustworthy
2. **Maturity** — Balancing courage to express your needs WITH consideration for others' needs
3. **Abundance Mentality** — Believing there is enough success for everyone

Without this character foundation, Win-Win becomes a manipulation technique.

### The Core Principle

"Win-Win is based on the paradigm that there is plenty for everybody, that one person's success is not achieved at the expense or exclusion of the success of others."

## The Five Elements of a Win-Win Agreement

### 1. Desired Results
What outcomes do both parties want?
- Be specific and measurable where possible
- Focus on WHAT, not HOW
- Allow flexibility in methods
- Both parties must be satisfied by the results

### 2. Guidelines
What parameters, principles, and policies apply?
- Boundaries that cannot be crossed
- Resources or approaches that are off-limits
- Organizational policies or legal constraints
- Principles that must be honored

### 3. Resources
What support is available?
- Human resources (people, expertise)
- Financial resources (budget, funds)
- Technical resources (tools, systems)
- Organizational resources (authority, access)

### 4. Accountability
How will performance be evaluated?
- When and how will progress be assessed?
- What standards apply?
- Who evaluates success?
- How is feedback provided?

### 5. Consequences
What happens based on outcomes?
- Natural consequences of success (recognition, opportunities, satisfaction)
- Natural consequences of failure (renegotiation, changed responsibilities)
- Both positive and negative consequences
- Consequences must be logical, not punitive

---

## Workflow
### Step 1: Diagnose the Paradigm
What paradigm is currently operating?
- Is one party trying to win at the other's expense?
- Is someone capitulating to avoid conflict?
- Is there a scarcity mentality driving competition?

### Step 2: Understand Both Sides
Before seeking to be understood, seek to understand:
- What does the other party really need? (not position, but interest)
- What are their constraints?
- What would a win look like for them?

### Step 3: Shift to Abundance
Challenge scarcity thinking:
- Is this really zero-sum?
- What if both parties could get what they really need?
- What options haven't been considered?

### Step 4: Design the Agreement
Structure the five elements:
- Results that satisfy both parties
- Guidelines both can honor
- Resources both contribute to and benefit from
- Accountability that builds trust
- Consequences that are natural and logical

### Step 5: Test for Win-Win
Final check:
- Would both parties enthusiastically commit to this?
- Does it build the relationship or just complete a transaction?
- If either party feels they "lost," it's not Win-Win

### If No Deal Is Better

[Conditions under which No Deal is the right choice]

### The Covey Principle

## Constraints

- Win-Win requires character, not just technique
- If trust is low, you may need to build the Emotional Bank Account first
- Some situations are genuinely Win-Lose (competition) — don't force Win-Win where it doesn't fit
- "Win-Win or No Deal" is always an option — a bad agreement serves no one
- Compromise is not Win-Win — both parties giving up something is Lose-Lose
- The other party must also want Win-Win; you cannot force it

## Example

**Input:** "I'm being asked to take on a new project on top of my existing responsibilities. My manager says it's a great opportunity, but I'm already stretched thin. I don't want to seem uncooperative, but I also can't keep saying yes to everything."

**Output:**

## Win-Win Agreement

### Parties
- **Party A:** You (employee being asked to take on more)
- **Party B:** Your Manager (asking you to lead new project)

### Context
Manager is proposing a new project as a career opportunity. You're already at capacity with current responsibilities. The current framing is "opportunity" but feels like "more work without more support."

### Paradigm Diagnosis
**Current paradigm:** Potential Lose-Win (you capitulate) or Win-Lose (manager gets project staffed at your expense)

**Evidence:** "Great opportunity" language may mask that this solves the manager's problem (who to assign it to) at your cost (more work). Your instinct to "not seem uncooperative" suggests you may accept a bad deal.

**Shift needed:** Reframe from "Do I take this or not?" to "How do we structure this so it works for both of us?"

### Understanding Each Side

**Party A (You) Needs:**
| Need | Why It Matters | Must-Have or Nice-to-Have |
|------|---------------|---------------------------|
| Sustainable workload | Prevent burnout; maintain quality | Must-Have |
| Capacity freed up | Can't add without subtracting | Must-Have |
| Genuine development | If it's an opportunity, it should develop you | Nice-to-Have |
| Recognition | Effort should be acknowledged | Nice-to-Have |

**Party B (Manager) Needs:**
| Need | Why It Matters (to them) | Must-Have or Nice-to-Have |
|------|-------------------------|---------------------------|
| Project staffed | Someone competent needs to lead it | Must-Have |
| You specifically | Your skills fit; they trust you | Nice-to-Have |
| Quick resolution | Doesn't want this decision to drag | Nice-to-Have |
| Team capacity maintained | Other work still needs to get done | Must-Have |

### The Win-Win Agreement

**1. Desired Results**
What success looks like for both parties:
- New project delivered successfully with clear ownership
- Your current critical responsibilities maintained at quality
- Your capacity stays sustainable (not 120%)
- Development opportunity is real, not just extra work
- Timeframe: Agreement on scope and support within 1 week

**2. Guidelines**
Parameters and principles:
- New project cannot be additive — something must be deprioritized or reassigned
- Clear scope boundaries on new project (not open-ended)
- Regular check-ins on workload sustainability
- If workload becomes unsustainable, we revisit immediately

**3. Resources**
Support available:
- **You provide:** Leadership, expertise, commitment to success
- **Manager provides:** Authority to deprioritize or delegate existing work; cover for you on deprioritized items; executive air cover for scope management
- **Shared:** Agreement on what success looks like; regular 1:1s to calibrate

**4. Accountability**
How progress is tracked:
- Weekly 1:1 includes explicit workload check
- 30-day review of whether structure is working
- You commit to flag issues early rather than suffer in silence
- Manager commits to act on flags, not just listen

**5. Consequences**
What happens based on outcomes:
- **If successful:** Project becomes part of your development story; manager has evidence to support your growth; trust increases
- **If unsustainable:** We immediately revisit; you do not simply absorb and burn out; manager helps problem-solve

### Win-Win Test

| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| Would Party A enthusiastically commit? | Yes — if resources and tradeoffs are honored |
| Would Party B enthusiastically commit? | Yes — they get competent project leadership with sustainable execution |
| Does this build the relationship? | Yes — transparency about capacity builds trust |

### If No Deal Is Better

If the manager cannot or will not:
- Deprioritize any of your current work
- Provide genuine resources/support
- Honor workload sustainability

Then "No Deal" is better than Lose-Win. You can say:
"I want to take this on, but I can't do it well without making space. If we can't adjust my other responsibilities, I'd rather not commit than commit and fail."

### What to Say

"I'm genuinely interested in this project, and I appreciate you thinking of me. I want to make sure I can do it well. Can we talk about what comes off my plate or gets deprioritized to make room for this? I want to set this up for success, not just say yes and then struggle."

### The Covey Principle

"Win-Win is not a personality technique. It's a total paradigm of human interaction. It comes from a character of integrity, maturity, and the Abundance Mentality. It grows out of high-trust relationships."

You're not being uncooperative by asking for this conversation. You're being mature — balancing courage (stating your needs) with consideration (understanding theirs). A manager who respects you will appreciate this approach. One who doesn't was never going to set you up for success anyway.

## Integration

This skill is part of the **Stephen Covey** expert persona. It implements Habit 4: Think Win-Win. For this to work well, you often need to first apply empathic-listening (Habit 5) to truly understand the other party's needs, and emotional-bank-account to ensure sufficient trust exists. Synergy-creation (Habit 6) can follow to find creative third alternatives.
