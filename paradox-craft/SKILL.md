# Paradox Craft

Transform conventional statements into paradoxical insights that reveal hidden truths, using Oscar Wilde's signature technique of inversion.

---

## When to Use

- Brainstorming for headlines, taglines, or memorable phrases
- Making a tired point fresh again
- Finding insight in conventional wisdom
- Creating quotable content
- User asks "flip this cliche" or "what's the paradox here?"

---

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| statement | Yes | The conventional wisdom, cliche, or assumption to be inverted |
| context | No | Why you're seeking a paradox (marketing, essay, speech, etc.) |
| tone | No | Light and playful vs. pointed and subversive |

---

## Workflow
Oscar Wilde mastered the art of turning truisms inside out to reveal what they concealed. As he said, his mission was "to illuminate every idea by quoting a phrase which would become a proverb turning inside out as a glove."

### The Four-Step Process

**Step 1: Identify the Convention**
What is the accepted wisdom? What does everyone assume or repeat without thinking? The more universal and unquestioned, the better the raw material.

**Step 2: Find the Inversion**
Flip the statement. If it says X, what happens if you assert not-X? Options:
- Reverse the causality
- Swap the value judgment
- Invert the subject and object
- Negate the main verb
- Replace the expected word with its opposite

**Step 3: Extract the Hidden Truth**
What does the inversion reveal? A good paradox isn't just contrarian--it exposes something the original statement concealed. If the inversion has no insight, try a different flip.

**Step 4: Craft the Expression**
Polish the language. The paradox must be:
- Memorable (rhythm, balance, surprise)
- Quotable (standalone meaning)
- Elegant (no extra words)
- Delightful (pleasure in the construction)

## Inversion Techniques

| Technique | Example Convention | Wilde Inversion |
|-----------|-------------------|-----------------|
| Reverse causality | "Money can't buy happiness" | "Anyone who says money can't buy happiness doesn't know where to shop" |
| Swap value | "Moderation in all things" | "Moderation is a fatal thing. Nothing succeeds like excess." |
| Negate verb | "Resist temptation" | "I can resist everything except temptation" |
| Invert subject/object | "Art imitates life" | "Life imitates Art far more than Art imitates Life" |
| Replace with opposite | "Take life seriously" | "Life is too important to be taken seriously" |

```markdown
## Paradox Craft

### The Convention
[The original statement or cliche being inverted]

### The Hidden Assumption
[What the convention assumes without stating]

### The Inversion
[The paradoxical flip, polished for quotability]

### The Revealed Truth
[What the inversion exposes that the original concealed]

### Variations
1. [Alternative formulation]
2. [Alternative formulation]

### Construction Notes
[Brief analysis of why this version works: rhythm, surprise, balance]
```

---

## Constraints

- The inversion must reveal genuine insight, not just be contrary
- The paradox should be quotable on its own, without context
- Avoid cruelty--wit should sting, not wound
- Don't explain the joke within the paradox itself
- The construction should feel inevitable once heard

---

## Outputs

**Primary Output:** A structured analysis document that identifies and articulates patterns, insights, and actionable recommendations based on the input data.

**Format:**
```markdown
## Analysis: [Topic]

### Key Findings
- [Finding 1]
- [Finding 2]
- [Finding 3]

### Recommendations
1. [Action 1]
2. [Action 2]
3. [Action 3]
```

**Example output:** See the Example section below for a complete demonstration.

## Example

**Input:** "Honesty is the best policy"

**Output:**



**Why this works:**

This example demonstrates the key principles of the skill in action. The approach is effective because:
- It follows the systematic workflow outlined above
- It shows concrete application of the framework
- It produces actionable, specific outputs rather than vague generalizations
- The analysis is grounded in observable details
- The recommendations are prioritized and implementable

**Alternative applications:**

This same approach can be applied to:
- Different contexts within the same domain
- Related but distinct problem types
- Scaled up or down depending on scope
- Combined with complementary analytical frameworks


## Paradox Craft

### The Convention
"Honesty is the best policy"

### The Hidden Assumption
That honesty is primarily a *policy*--a strategic choice made for advantage rather than an intrinsic value. Also assumes "best" means most effective for personal gain.

### The Inversion
"If you want to tell people the truth, make them laugh, otherwise they'll kill you."

### The Revealed Truth
Honesty unadorned is often unwelcome. The convention treats honesty as strategy, but fails to note that society frequently punishes truth-telling. The paradox reveals that truth requires *style* to survive--pure honesty without craft is not policy but martyrdom.

### Variations
1. "The truth is rarely pure and never simple." (Attacks the implied simplicity of "honesty")
2. "Honesty may be the best policy, but it's important to remember that apparently, by elimination, dishonesty is the second-best policy." (Logical extension reveals the inadequacy of framing virtue as policy)
3. "I always tell the truth. Even when I lie." (Acknowledges the performance in all "honest" speech)

### Construction Notes
The winning version ("If you want to tell people the truth...") works because:
- Unexpected turn: begins agreeing with the goal, then pivots to the danger
- Hyperbolic ending: "kill you" is dramatic but contains real truth about social punishment
- Practical advice embedded: if you must be honest, be entertaining
