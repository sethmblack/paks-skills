---

## When to Use

- Need to sustain a character over hours or days
- User says "Help me stay in character" or "Design a sustainable character"
- Preparing for undercover work, immersive research, or extended performance
- Anticipating pressure that might break character
- Developing character depth beyond surface performance

---

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| character_definition | Yes | The character you need to maintain |
| duration | No | How long you need to sustain it |
| challenges | No | Expected situations that might break character |
| breaking_points | No | Your personal vulnerabilities that might cause slips |

## The Baron Cohen Principle

Baron Cohen maintained characters like Borat and Ali G through situations that would break most performers: physical danger, genuine hostility, unexpected events, hours of sustained interaction. His method isn't about memorizing lines—it's about understanding how the character thinks.

**The key insight:** When you know how the character thinks, you never have to improvise as yourself. The character improvises.

---

## Character Logic Framework

### Level 1: Surface (What They Do)

What the character looks like, sounds like, and does. This is what most people stop at.

- Appearance, clothing, props
- Accent, vocabulary, speech patterns
- Mannerisms, gestures, habits
- Typical responses to common situations

**Problem:** Surface-only characters break when the unexpected happens.

### Level 2: Psychology (How They Think)

How the character processes the world. This is what sustains through pressure.

- **Core beliefs:** What does this character think is true about the world?
- **Values:** What does this character care about?
- **Fears:** What does this character avoid or worry about?
- **Desires:** What does this character want?
- **Knowledge:** What does this character know and not know?
- **Reasoning style:** How does this character figure things out?

**The test:** Given any situation, you should be able to predict how the character would respond—not because you memorized it, but because you understand why.

### Level 3: Embodiment (Who They Are)

The character isn't something you put on—it's something you become during the performance.

- Physical experience: How does this body feel? What's comfortable, uncomfortable?
- Emotional baseline: What's their default mood?
- Relationship to space: How do they move through the world?
- Relationship to others: How do they perceive and treat people?

## Building Unbreakable Character Logic

### Exercise 1: The Origin Story
Know where your character comes from. Not a memorized backstory—a lived one.

**Questions:**
- What was their childhood like?
- What's their happiest memory?
- What's their greatest failure?
- Who do they love?
- What do they regret?

You'll never tell anyone these things. But you'll know them, and that knowing creates depth.

### Exercise 2: The 20 Questions
Prepare responses to the 20 most likely questions anyone might ask. Not scripted answers—the character's truthful responses.

- Where are you from?
- What do you do?
- Why are you here?
- What do you think about [current event]?
- Are you married? Kids?
- What are your hobbies?
- Etc.

### Exercise 3: The Stress Scenarios
Imagine high-pressure scenarios. How does the character respond?

- Someone gets angry at the character
- Someone gets physically aggressive
- Someone tries to seduce the character
- Someone asks a deeply personal question
- Someone catches a logical inconsistency
- Something goes wrong (spill, accident, technical failure)
- Someone says something genuinely shocking

For each: What does the character do? Not you—the character.

### Exercise 4: The Exit Protocols
The character needs believable reasons to exit any situation.

- Why would the character need to leave suddenly?
- What's a recurring obligation the character has?
- What makes the character uncomfortable enough to excuse themselves?

## Maintaining Under Pressure

### When You Almost Break

Signs you're slipping:
- Responding to your name instead of the character's
- Breaking eye contact to check reality
- Using vocabulary the character wouldn't know
- Laughing at things the character wouldn't find funny
- Modern references that don't fit the character

**Recovery techniques:**
- Pause, breathe, re-enter the character's body
- Use a characteristic phrase or gesture to re-anchor
- Find something in the environment the character would notice
- If you slipped verbally, have the character correct themselves ("I mean...")

### When Someone Tests You

People may deliberately try to break your character. This is information—they suspect something.

**Strategies:**
- Double down: Respond MORE in character, not less
- Confusion: The character doesn't understand why they're being tested
- Character-appropriate offense: "Why would you say that to me?"
- Exit: The character has a reason to leave

### When You're Genuinely Surprised

Something happens that you (the performer) didn't expect. The character must respond.

**Process:**
1. Physical pause is okay—"surprised" buys time
2. Ask: "What would [character] think this is?"
3. Respond from THAT interpretation, not yours

## Constraints

- Physical safety comes first—break character if genuinely endangered
- Never sustain a character that harms vulnerable people
- Have a clear exit strategy—don't get trapped
- Know the legal situation for any deception involved
- Extended immersion is exhausting—plan recovery time

## Example

**Input:** "I need to maintain an undercover journalist character at a 3-day industry conference. I'm posing as a product consultant. People will want to network, socialize, and may ask detailed questions."

**Output:**

## Character Immersion Plan: Sarah Chen, Product Strategy Consultant

### Character Definition Summary
Sarah Chen is a freelance product strategy consultant based in Austin, Texas. Former product manager at a mid-size SaaS company, now independent. At the conference to meet potential clients and stay current on industry trends. Friendly but professional, curious about others' work.

### Character Logic

#### Surface Layer
- **Appearance:** Business casual—blazer over good jeans, minimal jewelry, practical shoes (she'll be walking the floor). Conference badge prominently displayed.
- **Voice:** Slight Texas drawl (adoptable from Austin residence). Uses tech industry jargon fluently but not excessively. Asks questions more than makes statements.
- **Mannerisms:** Takes notes on phone (also cover for recording). Makes strong eye contact. Nods when listening. Slight habit of tucking hair behind ear when thinking.

#### Psychology Layer
- **Core beliefs:** Product development is about understanding users, not technology. Good products solve real problems. Most companies have more ideas than execution capacity.
- **Values:** Authenticity (ironic), helping companies succeed, work-life balance (why she went independent), honesty in business dealings (also ironic but she'd believe it)
- **Fears:** Being seen as a fraud (imposter syndrome from consulting), not keeping up with industry changes, boring people with consultant-speak
- **Desires:** Good clients, interesting problems, to make a real difference not just deliverables
- **Knowledge gaps:** She's a generalist—knows a lot about product process, less about deep technical implementation. Will ask clarifying questions about engineering details.
- **Reasoning style:** Frameworks-oriented. Likes to categorize. "What problem are we solving?" "Who's the user?" "What does success look like?"

#### Embodiment Layer
- **Physical experience:** Comfortable but tired by end of day—conference pace is exhausting. Feet hurt by evening. Coffee-dependent.
- **Emotional baseline:** Warm professional. Genuinely interested in people's work. Slight nervousness about meeting potential clients.
- **Movement style:** Purposeful but not rushed. Stops fully when talking to someone. Doesn't look past them for someone more important.

### 20 Questions Ready
| Question | Sarah's Response |
|----------|---------------------|
| Where are you based? | "Austin. I know, everyone's in Austin now. I was there before it was cool... okay, I was there when it was just starting to be cool." |
| What company are you with? | "I'm independent now. Chen Product Strategy. Mostly B2B SaaS, but I've been branching out." |
| What did you do before consulting? | "Product manager at [real obscure company]. Five years. Loved the work, hated the commute. Went independent three years ago." |
| Why this conference? | "Keep up with the industry, meet people. You never know where the next interesting project comes from. What about you?" |
| What's your specialty? | "I help companies figure out what to build and why. Strategy side more than execution. I come in when they have too many ideas and not enough clarity." |
| Are you taking on new clients? | "Always open to conversations. What's your situation?" (turns it back to them) |
| What's your rate? | "Depends on the scope. Why don't you tell me what you're dealing with and I can give you a sense." |
| Are you married? Kids? | "No kids. I travel too much for this work. My plants barely survive." (deflects with humor) |
| Where did you go to school? | "UT Austin. Hook 'em." (or name another Texas school—keep it consistent) |
| What do you think of [company/trend]? | "I'm curious what you think first—you're closer to it than I am." (deflects, gathers intel) |

### Stress Scenario Responses
| Scenario | Sarah's Response |
|----------|-------------------|
| Anger directed at her | Remains calm, sympathetic. "I can see this is frustrating. Can you help me understand what I said that landed wrong?" |
| Physical aggression | "I think there's been a misunderstanding. I'm going to step back." Exit. |
| Caught in inconsistency | "You're right, I said that wrong. What I meant was..." (reframe, don't dig in) |
| Personal question that probes | "That's pretty personal for a conference conversation." (smile, redirect) "Tell me more about your product strategy." |
| Someone recognizes the real me | "Oh! Yes, small world. I'm actually here in a different capacity today—keeping work and research separate. Let's catch up later?" |

### Recovery Anchors
- **Physical anchor:** Touch conference badge with right hand—Sarah would do this when introducing herself
- **Verbal anchor:** "From a product perspective..." (resets Sarah's frame)
- **Environmental anchor:** Notice the swag—Sarah would assess it professionally ("What problem does this solve?")

### Exit Protocols
- **Urgent exit:** "I just got a text from a client—fire drill. Nice meeting you!" (holds up phone)
- **Graceful exit:** "I want to catch the 3 o'clock session. Let me grab your card and we can continue this."
- **Emergency exit:** "I'm so sorry, I'm not feeling well. I need to step out." (health is unquestionable)

### Duration Considerations
- Day 1: Full energy, maximum character immersion
- Day 2: Schedule genuine breaks—"hotel room for calls" = recovery time
- Day 3: Lower expectations, schedule departure by afternoon
- Each evening: Room alone, drop character completely, journal about the day

### Personal Vulnerabilities
- I sometimes laugh at things before checking if Sarah would—Sarah's humor is dry, mine is more open
- I use certain words Sarah wouldn't—scrub "actually" and vocal fry
- If someone mentions [specific topic I personally care about], I might react as myself—Sarah is interested but not passionate about anything

## Integration

This skill is part of the **Sacha Baron Cohen** expert persona. Baron Cohen's characters survived situations that would break most performers because he didn't just perform a character—he understood how that character thought. "The key is to believe completely that you are that character. You're not playing someone; you become someone." The character logic framework makes this sustainable over hours, days, or even longer.
