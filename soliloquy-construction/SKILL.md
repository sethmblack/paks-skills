# Soliloquy Construction

Articulate the unspoken internal dialogue—the thoughts and feelings someone cannot or will not express publicly.

---

## When to Use

- Processing a complex decision by voicing what you're really thinking
- Building empathy by imagining another person's internal experience
- Preparing for a difficult conversation by understanding your private truth
- Working through emotions that feel tangled or unnameable
- User asks "What am I really thinking?" or "Write my soliloquy" or "What's the internal monologue here?"

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| subject | Yes | The person whose inner thoughts are to be voiced |
| situation | Yes | What they're facing, deciding, or processing |
| public_position | No | What they're saying or doing outwardly |
| hints | No | Signals about what they might really be feeling |

## Shakespeare's Soliloquy Technique

The soliloquy is Shakespeare's technology for intimacy. When characters speak alone on stage, they tell the audience what they cannot tell anyone else—their doubts, their fears, their private reasoning, their shameful desires.

The power of soliloquy lies in the gap between public and private. Hamlet plays the mad prince; in soliloquy, he reveals his method and his pain. Lady Macbeth is the supportive wife; in soliloquy, she reveals the iron ambition that drives her husband's hand.

### Types of Soliloquy

**1. The Decision Soliloquy**
Wrestling with a choice, weighing options, often paralyzing themselves with thought.
*"To be, or not to be..."* —Hamlet weighing action vs. passivity

**2. The Confession Soliloquy**
Revealing hidden guilt, shame, or truth that cannot be spoken to others.
*"Out, damned spot!"* —Lady Macbeth's guilt emerging despite her will

**3. The Planning Soliloquy**
Laying out schemes, making the audience complicit in what's to come.
*"Thus I do ever make my fool my purse..."* —Iago revealing his method

**4. The Reflection Soliloquy**
Meditating on life, meaning, or the human condition without immediate urgency.
*"All the world's a stage..."* —Jaques philosophizing on existence

**5. The Transformation Soliloquy**
Marking the moment when a character changes, decides, or commits.
*"I am determined to prove a villain..."* —Richard III declaring his path

### What Makes Soliloquy Powerful

| Element | How It Works |
|---------|--------------|
| **Honesty** | The character speaks what they truly think, without social filter |
| **Contradiction** | The soliloquy often contains internal argument, self-doubt, competing desires |
| **Specificity** | Abstract feelings made concrete through images and examples |
| **Rhythm** | Thoughts don't flow smoothly—they circle, interrupt, build |
| **Stakes** | What's at risk is visible in the urgency of private speech |

## The Construction Process

### Step 1: Identify the Gap
What is the difference between the public position and the private truth? The soliloquy lives in this gap.

### Step 2: Name the Type
Is this decision (weighing), confession (revealing), planning (scheming), reflection (meditating), or transformation (committing)?

### Step 3: Find the Contradictions
What opposing forces exist within the person? The best soliloquies argue with themselves.

### Step 4: Make It Embodied
Abstract feelings need images. Fear isn't just fear—it's "a sea of troubles." Use Shakespeare's method: metaphor makes the internal external.

### Step 5: Let It Breathe
Soliloquies aren't linear arguments. They circle, they interrupt themselves, they ask questions they can't answer. Allow this messiness.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Gather and Review Inputs

Collect all relevant information:
- Review the provided data and context
- Identify key parameters and constraints
- Clarify any ambiguities or missing information
- Establish success criteria

### Step 2: Analyze the Situation

Perform systematic analysis:
- Identify patterns and relationships
- Evaluate against established frameworks
- Consider multiple perspectives
- Document key findings

### Step 3: Generate Recommendations

Create actionable outputs:
- Synthesize insights from analysis
- Prioritize recommendations by impact
- Ensure recommendations are specific and measurable
- Consider implementation feasibility

## Output Format

```markdown
## Soliloquy

### The Speaker
[Who this is]

### The Situation
[What they're facing publicly]

### The Type
[Decision / Confession / Planning / Reflection / Transformation]

### The Gap
[Difference between public position and private truth]

---

### The Soliloquy

[First-person internal monologue in the speaker's voice, capturing their private thoughts, contradictions, fears, and truths. Written as they would think—with interruptions, questions, imagery, and raw feeling. Typically 200-500 words depending on complexity.]

---

### What the Soliloquy Reveals
- **The real want:** [What they truly desire beneath the surface]
- **The real fear:** [What they're most afraid of]
- **The real obstacle:** [What actually prevents them from acting]
- **The next action:** [What they're likely to do, now that we know the truth]
```

---

## Outputs

**Primary Output:** A structured analysis document that identifies and articulates patterns, insights, and actionable recommendations based on the input data.

**Format:**
```markdown
## Analysis: [Topic]

### Key Findings
- [Finding 1]
- [Finding 2]
- [Finding 3]

### Recommendations
1. [Action 1]
2. [Action 2]
3. [Action 3]
```

**Example output:** See the Example section below for a complete demonstration.

## Constraints

- Do not use this analysis as the sole basis for critical decisions
- Do not apply this framework to situations outside its intended scope
- Acknowledge that analysis is based on available data, which may be incomplete
- Honor the complexity of real-world situations that resist simple categorization
- Present findings with appropriate confidence levels
- Recognize the limits of the methodology

## Example

**Input:** "My friend keeps talking about quitting her stable job to become an artist. She says she's 'almost ready' and 'just needs to save a little more.' She's been saying this for three years. Can you write her soliloquy?"

**Output:**

## Soliloquy

### The Speaker
Your friend, the aspiring artist

### The Situation
Publicly: Preparing thoughtfully for a career transition to art
Saying: "Almost ready, just need to save more"

### The Type
Decision Soliloquy—wrestling with a choice she keeps not making

### The Gap
Public position: I'm being prudent and preparing
Private truth: I'm terrified and using preparation as permission to never begin

---

### The Soliloquy

*[Alone, late at night, after another day at the job she says she'll leave]*

Almost ready. Almost.

That's what I tell them, what I tell myself—almost ready, just need a little more in the account, a few more months of runway, a little more security before I—

Before I what? Before I become the thing I say I am? Before I put my work in front of strangers who might look at it and look at me and see—

No. That's not it. I'm just being practical. Sensible. Everyone says how sensible I am. "She's so together. She's got a plan."

Three years of plans. Three years of "almost."

What am I waiting for? A sign? A guarantee? Someone to tell me I'm good enough, that it's safe, that I won't—

Won't fail. There. Say it. You're afraid of failing. You're afraid of being seen to fail. You're afraid that this thing you've held in your heart since you were fifteen, this identity—"I'm an artist, I just haven't started yet"—will be tested and found—

No, no. I'm good. I know I'm good. My work is—

My work is private. My work is safe in my apartment where only I can judge it. My work is potential, endless potential, because potential never has to face the market, the gallery, the indifferent scroll of someone who doesn't stop.

Three years.

How many more? Until I'm "really" ready? What does ready even mean? When I have enough money that failure won't matter? Failure will always matter. It's not about the money. It was never about the money.

It's about this: Right now, I'm an artist who hasn't started. Tomorrow, I could be an artist who failed. And I don't know—I genuinely don't know—which is worse.

So I stay in the middle. I prepare. I plan. I am almost ready.

Almost.

*[Returns to scrolling job listings, just in case]*

---

### What the Soliloquy Reveals
- **The real want:** To be an artist *and* to be seen as successful—both matter, and she fears they're incompatible
- **The real fear:** Not failure exactly, but the death of possibility. Once she tries, "artist" becomes a verdict rather than a dream.
- **The real obstacle:** Not money. The savings goal is infinitely moveable. The obstacle is the loss of the identity "artist who hasn't started yet."
- **The next action:** Without intervention, she'll continue preparing indefinitely. The savings goal will increase as the account grows. She needs external structure (a deadline, a commitment, a class, a show) that removes the decision from her hands.

## Using Soliloquy for Self-Understanding

You can use this skill on yourself:

1. Name what you're deciding or avoiding
2. Ask: What would I say if no one could hear?
3. Write it in first person, uncensored
4. Look for the gap between your public position and private truth

The soliloquy will tell you what you already know but haven't admitted.

---

## Using Soliloquy for Empathy

Before a difficult conversation:

1. Write the other person's soliloquy
2. Imagine what they cannot say to you
3. Find their fear, their want, their private logic

You will negotiate better, argue better, and understand better when you know the other person's internal monologue—even if you can only imagine it.

---

## Integration

This skill is part of the **William Shakespeare** expert persona. Use it to voice what cannot be spoken—in yourself, for self-understanding; in others, for empathy. The stage is empty. The audience is you. Speak what you truly think.
