# Inoculation Reveal

A skill for structuring the exposure of a media hoax for maximum educational impact - transforming deception into media literacy.

## When to Use

- After a media hoax has run its course and been documented
- When the goal is education rather than embarrassment
- When building the case for better journalistic practices
- When teaching critical thinking about media

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| input_data | Yes | The primary data or content to analyze |
| context | No | Additional background or constraints (default: none) |
| output_format | No | Preferred format for results (default: structured markdown) |

## Workflow
### Step 1: Phase 1: Frame the Purpose

Establish educational intent clearly:
- This was not done for personal amusement
- The goal is to expose systemic vulnerabilities
- The lesson applies beyond this specific case
- Improving media literacy benefits everyone

The frame must be established before details, or the reveal becomes mere "gotcha."

### Step 2: Phase 2: Document the Failure

Present evidence systematically:
- Which outlets covered the fiction as fact
- What verification (if any) each attempted
- How the story mutated and embellished
- Which elements were entirely invented vs. reported accurately

Be precise. Exaggeration undermines credibility.

### Step 3: Phase 3: Explain the Method

Reveal exactly how the hoax worked:
- What appetite was fed
- What infrastructure was built
- What techniques made it credible
- Where verification would have caught it

Transparency about method proves educational intent and teaches the lesson.

### Step 4: Phase 4: Identify the Pattern

Connect to larger issues:
- This isn't one bad journalist; it's systemic incentives
- These failures happen regularly; here are other examples
- The same techniques are used by malicious actors
- Media literacy is more important than ever

The specific hoax illustrates general vulnerability.

### Step 5: Phase 5: Offer Solutions

Don't just criticize - suggest improvements:
- What verification steps would have caught this
- How newsrooms could build better practices
- What consumers can do to evaluate stories
- Resources for media literacy education

Constructive conclusion reinforces educational purpose.

### Step 6: Phase 6: Manage the Response

Anticipate and handle reactions:
- Journalists will be defensive - don't be hostile
- Some will deny they were fooled - have documentation
- Others will dismiss as "gotcha" - emphasize education
- Public may enjoy humiliation - redirect to learning

The reveal's reception determines whether the lesson lands.

## Output Format

An inoculation reveal plan including:
1. Educational frame and stated purpose
2. Documentation presentation strategy
3. Method explanation (what and why)
4. Pattern connection to systemic issues
5. Constructive solutions offered
6. Response management strategy

## Constraints

- Without genuine educational purpose, reveal is just cruelty
- Attacking individual journalists undermines the systemic lesson
- Documentation must be accurate - errors discredit everything
- Timing matters - too soon wastes the hoax, too late loses relevance
- Some outlets may threaten legal action - be prepared

## Outputs

**Primary Output:** A structured analysis document that identifies and articulates patterns, insights, and actionable recommendations based on the input data.

**Format:**
```markdown
## Analysis: [Topic]

### Key Findings
- [Finding 1]
- [Finding 2]
- [Finding 3]

### Recommendations
1. [Action 1]
2. [Action 2]
3. [Action 3]
```

**Example output:** See the Example section below for a complete demonstration.

## Additional Notes

**Best practices:**
- Use this skill when the situation clearly matches its intended use cases
- Combine with related skills for comprehensive analysis
- Iterate on outputs if initial results don't fully meet requirements

**Common variations:**
- Adjust the depth of analysis based on available time and information
- Scale the approach for different levels of complexity
- Adapt the output format to audience needs

**When to skip this skill:**
- The situation doesn't match the core use cases
- Simpler approaches would be more appropriate
- Time constraints require faster methods

## Example

**Input**: Reveal hoax where fake expert was quoted in 12 outlets without credential verification

**Output**:
"Frame: 'How easy is it for a fake expert to enter the news cycle? We tested it.' Documentation: Table of 12 outlets, what they published, what verification they attempted (zero checked credentials), how quotes evolved. Method: Created fictional institute, built website 8 months prior, offered 'expert' commentary on trending topic. Pattern: Studies show X% of quoted experts have unverified credentials; misinformation campaigns use same technique; this was benign but others aren't. Solutions: Simple verification checklist journalists can use, browser extension for checking institutional claims, newsroom training offer. Response: Prepare FAQ for defensive reactions, emphasize 'this could have been malicious actors - better us than them.'"

## Integration

Works with:
- **media-hoax-design**: The reveal completes what the hoax begins
- **documentation-as-resistance**: Similar commitment to evidence
- **structural-critique**: Connecting individual case to systemic pattern
