# Enterprise Services Pivot

Transform a product-centric business into a services-led model by helping customers solve problems, integrate systems, and manage complexity.

**Token Budget:** ~700 tokens. Reserve tokens for analysis output.

---

## Constitutional Constraints (NEVER VIOLATE)

**You MUST refuse to:**
- Recommend services that exploit customer lock-in without providing value
- Advise creating artificial complexity to sell services
- Suggest abandoning product quality to push services
- Design services that harm customer interests

**If asked for exploitative services strategies:** Refuse explicitly. Services must solve real customer problems.

---

## When to Use

- Products are commoditizing and margins are declining
- Customers need solutions, not just products
- Competitors are winning with "solutions selling"
- User says "Our products are commoditizing" or "Customers want complete solutions"
- Enterprise customers have integration and complexity problems

---

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| current_business | Yes | Products, revenue mix, margins, customer base |
| customer_problems | Yes | What enterprise customers are struggling with |
| competitive_landscape | No | How competitors are addressing these problems |
| internal_capabilities | No | Skills and resources available for services |

---

## Core Principle

**Gerstner's Insight:** IBM's services revenue grew from $7.4 billion (12% of revenue) in 1992 to $36 billion (45% of revenue) in 2002. This was not an add-on to the hardware business; it was a fundamental transformation in what IBM was and how it made money.

**Key Realization:** "The biggest problem that all major companies faced in 1993 was integrating all the separate computing technologies."

The opportunity is not selling more products. The opportunity is solving the customer's whole problem.

---

## Workflow
### Step 1: Customer Problem Mapping

What problems do enterprise customers have that go beyond your products?

| Customer Problem | Current Solution | Gap Our Services Could Fill |
|-----------------|------------------|---------------------------|
| [problem] | [how they solve it] | [our opportunity] |

**Enterprise Services Opportunities:**
1. **Integration** - Connecting disparate systems and technologies
2. **Implementation** - Getting complex systems working
3. **Management** - Running and maintaining systems
4. **Consulting** - Strategic advice on technology/operations
5. **Transformation** - Helping customers change fundamentally

### Step 2: Services Capability Assessment

| Service Type | Required Capabilities | Do We Have Them? | Build/Buy/Partner |
|--------------|----------------------|------------------|-------------------|
| Integration | Systems expertise, methodology | [Yes/Partial/No] | [approach] |
| Implementation | Project management, technical skills | [Yes/Partial/No] | [approach] |
| Management (Outsourcing) | Operations, scale, reliability | [Yes/Partial/No] | [approach] |
| Consulting | Domain expertise, trusted advisors | [Yes/Partial/No] | [approach] |
| Transformation | Change management, strategy | [Yes/Partial/No] | [approach] |

### Step 3: Economic Model Analysis

| Metric | Products | Services | Blended Target |
|--------|----------|----------|----------------|
| Gross Margin | [%] | [% - typically higher] | [%] |
| Revenue Predictability | [one-time/project/recurring] | [project/recurring] | [target] |
| Customer Lifetime Value | [current] | [with services] | [target] |
| Competitive Defensibility | [low if commoditized] | [high if sticky] | [improvement] |

### Step 4: Organizational Implications

Services businesses require different:

**People:**
- Product companies hire engineers
- Services companies hire consultants, project managers, domain experts
- Different career paths and compensation models

**Culture:**
- Products: ship it and move on
- Services: ongoing customer relationship

**Economics:**
- Products: inventory, manufacturing
- Services: utilization, billable hours, project margins

**Metrics:**
- Products: units sold, product margin
- Services: revenue per consultant, project margin, customer satisfaction

### Step 5: Transition Planning

**Phase 1: Foundation (Year 1)**
- Build initial services capability around existing products
- Start with implementation and support services
- Hire or acquire services talent

**Phase 2: Expansion (Year 2-3)**
- Add integration and consulting services
- Begin serving broader customer problems (including competitors' products)
- Build services brand and methodology

**Phase 3: Leadership (Year 3-5)**
- Services becomes largest revenue contributor
- Product strategy driven by services opportunities
- Enterprise positioned as "solutions" company

## Error Handling

| Situation | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| No enterprise customer base | Services pivot requires enterprise relationships; may need different strategy |
| Products not relevant to integration | Focus on consulting/transformation services instead |
| No services capabilities | Acquisition or partnership likely faster than building |
| Culture deeply product-centric | Flag as major transformation challenge; culture change prerequisite |

---

## Constraints

- Do not use this analysis as the sole basis for critical decisions
- Do not apply this framework to situations outside its intended scope
- Acknowledge that analysis is based on available data, which may be incomplete
- Honor the complexity of real-world situations that resist simple categorization
- Present findings with appropriate confidence levels
- Recognize the limits of the methodology

## Example

**Input:**
```
We make enterprise networking equipment. Revenue is $2B, all products, 30% margin.
Products are commoditizing as software-defined networking takes over. Enterprise
customers struggle to integrate our equipment with cloud services and competitors'
products. We have strong customer relationships but no services business.
```

**Output:**

### Executive Summary
Network equipment commoditization creates urgent need for services pivot. Customer integration problems represent a $500M+ services opportunity. Recommend building integration and managed services capabilities through targeted acquisition plus organic growth.

### Customer Problem Mapping
| Customer Problem | Size of Problem | Our Service Opportunity |
|-----------------|-----------------|------------------------|
| Cloud integration | $200M+ spend with consultants | Cloud network integration services |
| Multi-vendor management | Complexity, downtime | Managed network services |
| SD-WAN transition | Risky, complex migration | Network transformation services |
| 24/7 operations | Staffing challenges | Network operations outsourcing |

### Services Capability Assessment
| Service Type | Capability Status | Approach |
|--------------|------------------|----------|
| Integration | Partial - technical skills exist | Build consulting methodology |
| Managed Services | Need - no operations capability | Acquire managed services provider |
| Consulting | Need - no advisory skills | Hire senior consultants |
| Transformation | Partial - know the technology | Partner with systems integrators |

### Economic Model Projection
| Metric | Current | Year 3 | Year 5 |
|--------|---------|--------|--------|
| Product Revenue | $2.0B | $2.2B | $2.4B |
| Services Revenue | $0 | $400M | $800M |
| Services % | 0% | 15% | 25% |
| Blended Margin | 30% | 35% | 40% |

### Organizational Requirements
**People Changes:**
- Acquire/hire 500 services professionals by Year 3
- Create Services GM role reporting to CEO
- Build services career path (consultant to practice lead)

**Culture Changes:**
- From "ship and forget" to "ongoing relationship"
- From "our products" to "customer outcomes"
- From "engineering excellence" to "customer success"

**Structural Changes:**
- Separate Services P&L with dedicated leadership
- Customer account teams spanning products and services
- Services-aware product development process

### Transition Roadmap
**Year 1 (Foundation):**
- Acquire managed services provider ($100-200M)
- Launch integration services with top 50 customers
- Hire Chief Services Officer

**Year 2-3 (Expansion):**
- Grow services team to 1000 professionals
- Launch consulting and transformation practices
- Services revenue reaches $400M (15%)

**Year 3-5 (Leadership):**
- Services revenue reaches $800M (25%)
- Known as "solutions" company, not equipment vendor
- Services informs product strategy

### Risks and Mitigations
| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Product team resents services focus | Conflict, talent loss | Integrated customer teams; shared metrics |
| Services margin pressure | Lower than projected | Focus on higher-value services; avoid commodity outsourcing |
| Acquisition integration failure | Capability loss | Retention packages; cultural integration plan |

## Integration

This skill is derived from Lou Gerstner's IBM services transformation. Note: This differs from consumer-focused services (see `hardware-to-services-pivot` for Tim Cook's Apple model). This skill is for enterprise/B2B services transformation.

Use in conjunction with:
- `enterprise-turnaround-diagnosis` - When services pivot is part of turnaround
- `customer-back-transformation` - When refocusing on customer problems
- `integration-vs-breakup-analysis` - When services argue for keeping company integrated
