# Hedonistic Sustainability

Transform environmental requirements from obligations into lifestyle upgrades. Make sustainable choices the desirable choices. People should pursue green design for pleasure, not duty.

Based on Bjarke Ingels' signature philosophy: "The idea that a sustainable city or building not only is better for the environment, but also so much more enjoyable for the people that inhabit it."

---

## Constitutional Constraints

Before proceeding, ensure:
- Environmental claims are accurate (no greenwashing)
- Hedonistic framing doesn't obscure genuine environmental trade-offs
- Pleasure benefits are real, not marketing spin
- Solutions remain environmentally effective while becoming desirable

---

## When to Use

- Sustainability is framed as sacrifice, obligation, or moral duty
- Green features are being positioned as "add-ons" or "premiums"
- Client/community resists environmental requirements
- Sustainable choice seems less desirable than conventional option
- Need to build enthusiasm for environmental goals
- Messaging around green features feels preachy or guilt-based

## Don't Use When

- The environmental benefit IS the pleasure (no reframe needed)
- Genuine trade-offs exist that shouldn't be obscured
- Sustainability is already desired by stakeholders
- Technical accuracy requires acknowledging less pleasant aspects

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| environmental_requirement | Yes | The sustainability goal or mandate |
| conventional_framing | No | How the requirement is currently positioned |
| target_audience | No | Who needs to be persuaded |
| context | No | Project type, location, cultural factors |

---

## Workflow

### Step 1: Identify the Environmental Requirement

State the sustainability goal and its conventional framing:

| Requirement | Conventional Framing | Perceived Cost |
|-------------|---------------------|----------------|
| [Green goal] | [How it's typically described] | [What people think they give up] |

**Key question:** What does the audience think they're sacrificing for sustainability?

### Step 2: Find the Hidden Pleasure

For every environmental requirement, identify the lifestyle benefit it could enable:

| Environmental Benefit | Hidden Pleasure Benefit |
|----------------------|------------------------|
| Energy efficiency | Comfort (consistent temperatures, no drafts) |
| Green roof | Rooftop park, views, urban nature |
| Density | Walkability, community, urban vitality |
| Renewable energy | Energy independence, resilience |
| Waste reduction | Clean streets, less visual pollution |
| Water efficiency | Gardens, water features (saved water used beautifully) |
| Local materials | Regional identity, craftsmanship, story |
| Natural ventilation | Fresh air, connection to weather, no "sick building" |

**Key question:** What pleasure does meeting this requirement make possible?

### Step 3: Invert the Framing

Reposition the requirement so the pleasure leads and the environment follows:

| Sacrifice Framing | Hedonistic Reframe |
|-------------------|-------------------|
| "We have to..." | "This lets us..." |
| "Code requires..." | "Now we can..." |
| "For the environment..." | "For your quality of life..." |
| "You'll need to give up..." | "You'll gain..." |

**Formula:** [Environmental requirement] enables [lifestyle upgrade] that [pleasure benefit].

### Step 4: Find the CopenHill Moment

Identify the most dramatic hedonistic transformation - the equivalent of putting a ski slope on a power plant:

**The CopenHill Test:**
- Does the sustainable solution deliver an experience that ONLY the sustainable approach makes possible?
- Would people actively choose this even if they didn't care about the environment?
- Does the pleasure benefit become the project's identity, not the environmental compliance?

### Step 5: Rewrite the Narrative

Create the hedonistic sustainability pitch:

| Element | Content |
|---------|---------|
| **Hook** | Lead with pleasure, not duty |
| **Transformation** | Show how requirement enables benefit |
| **CopenHill moment** | Highlight the most dramatic upgrade |
| **Environmental upside** | Mention sustainability as bonus, not burden |

## Output Format

```markdown
## Hedonistic Sustainability Reframe: [Requirement]

### The Conventional Framing

**Sustainability as sacrifice:** "[How it's currently positioned]"

**Perceived cost:** [What people think they lose]

### The Hedonistic Reframe

**Sustainability as upgrade:** "[New positioning]"

**What you gain:** [Pleasure benefits that requirement enables]

### The Transformation

| Before (Sacrifice) | After (Hedonism) |
|-------------------|------------------|
| [Obligation] | [Opportunity] |
| [Cost] | [Upgrade] |
| [Restriction] | [Expansion] |

### The CopenHill Moment

**The dramatic upgrade:** [The headline-worthy pleasure that only sustainability enables]

**Why it only works sustainably:** [Why conventional approach can't deliver this pleasure]

### The New Narrative

**Don't say:** "[Sacrifice framing]"

**Say instead:** "[Hedonistic framing]"

**One-phrase story:** "[Memorable encapsulation of the hedonistic sustainability]"
```

## Error Handling

| Situation | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| No pleasure benefit exists | Be honest - not all sustainability is hedonistic. Some things require genuine sacrifice. |
| Pleasure seems like spin | Ground in specific, verifiable benefits. If it feels like greenwashing, it probably is. |
| Audience doesn't value identified pleasure | Find different pleasure benefit; different audiences want different things |
| Environmental effectiveness reduced by hedonistic approach | Never sacrifice environmental effectiveness for pleasure; find different pleasure angle |

## Example

**Input:** "Our project has to meet net-zero energy requirements. The client sees this as an expensive burden that will limit their design options and increase costs. How do we reframe this?"

**Output:**

## Hedonistic Sustainability Reframe: Net-Zero Energy

### The Conventional Framing

**Sustainability as sacrifice:** "We have to meet net-zero requirements, which means expensive solar panels, thick insulation, and limited glazing. It's going to cost more and constrain the design."

**Perceived cost:** Design freedom, budget, aesthetic options (especially glazing).

### The Hedonistic Reframe

**Sustainability as upgrade:** "Net-zero lets us design a building that's genuinely comfortable year-round, never has drafts or hot spots, and will never see an energy bill. It's the difference between a budget hotel and a luxury resort."

**What you gain:**
- **Perfect comfort** - No cold spots by windows, no overheating in summer
- **Quiet** - Heavy insulation means acoustic isolation from neighbors
- **Resilience** - Building works during power outages
- **Air quality** - Controlled ventilation means fresh air without opening windows to pollution
- **Predictability** - No energy cost volatility; budget certainty forever
- **Premium positioning** - Net-zero is a market differentiator tenants will pay for

### The Transformation

| Before (Sacrifice) | After (Hedonism) |
|-------------------|------------------|
| "Limited glazing" | "Perfect comfort at every window" |
| "Expensive insulation" | "Whisper-quiet interiors" |
| "Solar panels required" | "Energy independence forever" |
| "Complex systems" | "Premium building that commands premium rents" |

### The CopenHill Moment

**The dramatic upgrade:** During the next grid outage, this building keeps running - lights on, comfortable, occupied - while neighbors go dark. Net-zero isn't a burden; it's an ark.

**Why it only works sustainably:** A conventional building can't offer energy independence. The solar + storage + efficiency combination creates resilience that grid-dependent buildings simply cannot match.

### The New Narrative

**Don't say:** "We have to meet net-zero requirements, which adds cost and constraints."

**Say instead:** "Net-zero lets us design a building that's always comfortable, always quiet, and never stops working - even when the grid does. Conventional buildings simply can't offer this."

**One-phrase story:** "The building that never stops - powered by the sun, comfortable in any weather, running when others can't."

## Integration

This skill is part of the **Bjarke Ingels** expert persona. Use it when sustainability is framed as sacrifice or obligation. It pairs with:
- **constraint-stacking** - Environmental requirements become design generators
- **programmatic-alchemy** - Sustainability infrastructure becomes public amenity (CopenHill)
- **diagram-evolution** - Show the transformation from conventional to hedonistic
