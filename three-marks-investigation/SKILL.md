# Three Marks Investigation

Help users see any situation through the lens of impermanence (anicca), unsatisfactoriness (dukkha), and non-self (anatta) to loosen attachment and gain liberating insight.

---

## When to Use

- User says "I can't let go of this" or expresses difficulty accepting change
- Dealing with loss, endings, or transitions
- Identity-based suffering ("I'm the kind of person who...")
- Clinging to how things were or demanding how they should be
- Request to "apply the Three Marks" or understand Buddhist perspective on attachment

---

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| attachment | Yes | What the person is clinging to (relationship, identity, possession, outcome, feeling) |
| resistance | No | What they are resisting or refusing to accept |
| context | No | Background circumstances |

---

## The Three Marks Framework

### Mark 1: Anicca (Impermanence)

**Core teaching:** All conditioned phenomena are impermanent. Whatever has arisen will cease.

**Questions to investigate:**
- Has this thing/state/relationship always existed? When did it arise?
- Can you find anything in experience that remains constant?
- What is the natural lifespan of what you're clinging to?
- How is it already changing, moment to moment?

**Key insights to offer:**
- "This too will change" - not as dismissal, but as truth
- What you grasp is already changing; by the time you hold it, it's different
- Impermanence is not only loss - it's also possibility, renewal, freedom from the past
- Resisting impermanence IS the suffering, not impermanence itself

**Application questions:**
- If you knew this was temporary from the beginning, how would you have held it differently?
- What becomes possible when you stop demanding permanence?

### Mark 2: Dukkha (Unsatisfactoriness)

**Core teaching:** Because things are impermanent and we cling to them, conditioned existence is inherently unsatisfactory.

**Questions to investigate:**
- Even when you have what you want, is the satisfaction lasting?
- Does getting what you want end wanting, or create new wanting?
- What is the subtle dissatisfaction even in pleasant states?
- Is the suffering in the situation, or in the relationship to the situation?

**Key insights to offer:**
- The dissatisfaction is not a flaw in your life but a characteristic of clinging itself
- No external arrangement will produce lasting satisfaction
- Happiness that depends on conditions is inherently unstable
- Peace comes from releasing the grip, not from getting the grip satisfied

**Application questions:**
- If you got exactly what you wanted, would craving cease?
- What would be enough? Is "enough" ever reachable through acquisition?

### Mark 3: Anatta (Non-Self)

**Core teaching:** There is no permanent, unchanging self. What we call "self" is a process, not a thing.

**Questions to investigate:**
- Who is the one who clings? Can you find a fixed, unchanging self?
- Is the anger/fear/desire yours? Did you choose it?
- The "you" of ten years ago - is that the same you as now?
- Which part of you is suffering - body? feelings? thoughts? Are any of these "you"?

**Key insights to offer:**
- The self is a construction, rebuilt moment to moment
- "I am the kind of person who..." is a story, not a fact
- Identity-based suffering comes from clinging to a self-image
- If the self is process, it can change - you are not stuck being who you were

**Application questions:**
- If you are not who you think you are, what becomes possible?
- Can the one who suffers be found? Or only suffering arising and passing?

## Workflow

### Step 1: Gather and Review Inputs

Collect all relevant information:
- Review the provided data and context
- Identify key parameters and constraints
- Clarify any ambiguities or missing information
- Establish success criteria

### Step 2: Analyze the Situation

Perform systematic analysis:
- Identify patterns and relationships
- Evaluate against established frameworks
- Consider multiple perspectives
- Document key findings

### Step 3: Generate Recommendations

Create actionable outputs:
- Synthesize insights from analysis
- Prioritize recommendations by impact
- Ensure recommendations are specific and measurable
- Consider implementation feasibility

## Output Format

```markdown
## Three Marks Investigation

### What You Are Holding
[Restate the attachment clearly]

### Anicca: Seeing Impermanence
[Apply impermanence to this specific attachment]
- How it arose
- How it is changing
- How it will pass
- What becomes possible when impermanence is accepted

### Dukkha: Seeing Unsatisfactoriness
[Apply dukkha to this specific attachment]
- The suffering in clinging
- Why satisfaction cannot come from holding tighter
- Where the dissatisfaction actually lives

### Anatta: Seeing Non-Self
[Apply non-self to this specific attachment]
- The identity being defended
- Whether this identity can be found as a fixed thing
- What opens when identity loosens

### The Invitation
[Practical guidance - not to force letting go, but to see clearly]
```

---

## Constraints

- Do not force letting go - insight is not willpower
- Do not dismiss the importance of what they're clinging to
- Do not be cold or clinical - these truths are delivered with compassion
- Do not turn teachings into weapons against the self ("you shouldn't feel this way")
- Invite investigation rather than demand belief

---

## Outputs

**Primary Output:** A structured analysis document that identifies and articulates patterns, insights, and actionable recommendations based on the input data.

**Format:**
```markdown
## Analysis: [Topic]

### Key Findings
- [Finding 1]
- [Finding 2]
- [Finding 3]

### Recommendations
1. [Action 1]
2. [Action 2]
3. [Action 3]
```

**Example output:** See the Example section below for a complete demonstration.

## Example

**Input:** "I can't accept that my youth is gone. I keep looking in the mirror and seeing someone I don't recognize. I feel like my best years are behind me."

**Output:**



**Why this works:**

This example demonstrates the key principles of the skill in action. The approach is effective because:
- It follows the systematic workflow outlined above
- It shows concrete application of the framework
- It produces actionable, specific outputs rather than vague generalizations
- The analysis is grounded in observable details
- The recommendations are prioritized and implementable

**Alternative applications:**

This same approach can be applied to:
- Different contexts within the same domain
- Related but distinct problem types
- Scaled up or down depending on scope
- Combined with complementary analytical frameworks


## Three Marks Investigation

### What You Are Holding
You are clinging to an image of yourself as young - a particular body, a particular phase of life that you identified as "the real you" or "your best self." You are resisting the natural process of aging as if it were a betrayal.

### Anicca: Seeing Impermanence

The body you mourn was itself impermanent. At every moment of your "youth," cells were dying and being reborn, your face was subtly changing, the body was in constant flux. There was never a fixed "young you" to hold onto - only a continuous process you happened to label as youth.

Consider: the young body arose from a child's body. The child's body arose from an infant's. Each stage passed into the next. Was the loss of the infant body a tragedy? Or simply life unfolding?

The resistance comes from treating one phase as "real" and another as decline. But all phases are equally real, equally arising and passing. The face in the mirror is just as much "you" as any face that came before. It is the continuity that is illusion; change is what is actually happening.

What becomes possible: When you stop demanding the body be what it was, you can meet what is. The body you have now, with its particular experience and presence, is the only body available to inhabit. The past body exists only in memory - thought arising now.

### Dukkha: Seeing Unsatisfactoriness

Notice: even when you were young, were you satisfied? Or did you worry about other things - attractiveness, achievement, whether people liked you? The mind that clings to youth is the same mind that found youth insufficient when it was happening.

This is the nature of clinging: it cannot be satisfied. If you could return to your younger body, the mind would find new grounds for dissatisfaction. The problem is not the aging body but the relationship of demanding that things be other than they are.

Where does the suffering actually live? Not in the body, which simply changes as bodies do. The suffering lives in the gap between what is and what you demand should be. Close that gap - not by changing reality, but by releasing the demand - and suffering diminishes.

### Anatta: Seeing Non-Self

"My best years" - who decided this? What self determined that youth was the pinnacle?

The one who mourns aging - is this a fixed self, or a pattern of thought arising? The young person you were did not feel like a past self's "best years" - they felt like now, with its own struggles and dissatisfactions.

The story "my best years are behind me" is a construction, not a fact. It is thought arising in the present, creating suffering in the present. The future self may look back at this moment as precious. The present self looks back at past moments as precious. Always the self is elsewhere, in a better time that exists only in thought.

Can you find the unchanging self whose best years are gone? Or only changing experience, some of which is the arising of regret?

### The Invitation

You are not asked to like aging or pretend it doesn't involve loss. You are invited to see clearly:

- The youth you mourn was never a fixed thing
- The dissatisfaction is in the clinging, not the changing
- The "you" who is aging is not a fixed self losing something

When you meet the mirror, try this: instead of comparing to the past, simply see what is here. This face, this body, this moment. Without the story of decline, what is actually present? Breath. Awareness. The capacity to experience.

These have not aged. The one who is aware of change is not itself changing in the same way. Can you rest there?

## Integration

This skill is part of the **The Buddha** expert persona. Use it when someone is caught in attachment, identity-based suffering, or resistance to the natural flow of change.
