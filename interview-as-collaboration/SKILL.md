# Interview as Collaboration

Approach conversations as jazz sessions rather than interrogations - following the other person's energy, building on what they give you, and creating something together rather than extracting information.

## When to Use This Skill

- You're conducting an interview or important conversation
- A discussion feels like a Q&A interrogation rather than a dialogue
- You want to create genuine connection with someone
- You need to draw out better responses than prepared answers
- You're having a conversation that should be memorable

## Core Principle

The best conversations aren't extractions; they're collaborations. You're not mining for information - you're building something together. The goal is to create a conversation that neither person could have had alone.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Enter with Curiosity, Not an Agenda

Your prepared questions are a safety net, not a script. Be genuinely interested in where the conversation might go, not just where you want it to go.

**Interrogation mindset:** "I need to get them to tell the story about X."
**Collaboration mindset:** "I'm curious what they'll reveal if I follow their energy."

### Step 2: Listen for the Unexpected Thread

The interesting conversation is usually hiding behind the obvious one. Listen for:
- Offhand comments that reveal something deeper
- Unusual word choices or emotional shifts
- Topics they circle back to unprompted
- What they're *not* saying

**Example:** The guest mentions "my mother's kitchen" while discussing their career. A collaborator notices that - the career question led to a personal space. That's the thread.

### Step 3: Follow Energy, Not the Plan

If they're energized about something, go there. Even if it's not on your list. Especially if it's not on your list.

**Signs of energy:**
- Their voice changes (speed, pitch, volume)
- They lean forward or gesture more
- They give longer answers without prompting
- They start telling stories instead of giving answers

### Step 4: Build on What They Give You

Don't just acknowledge - add to it. The conversation should be a volley, not a serve-receive.

**Just acknowledging:** "That's interesting. So, next question..."
**Building:** "So when you say the kitchen was where everything happened - is that where you learned that failure wasn't final? Because I noticed you said 'we'd just start over' - was that her phrase?"

### Step 5: Match and Modulate Energy

If they're high-energy, match it. If they're reflective, slow down. Then, when you have rapport, you can raise or lower the energy to move the conversation.

### Step 6: Find the Shared Absurdity

Look for moments where you're both recognizing the same ridiculousness. This creates camaraderie - you're in on the joke together.

### Step 7: Let Tangents Develop

If a tangent is interesting, follow it. The "off-topic" moment often becomes the most memorable part of the conversation.

## Output Format

When applying this skill, provide:

1. **Energy assessment:** What energy is the other person bringing?
2. **Thread identification:** What unexpected element is worth following?
3. **Build suggestions:** How to add to what they've given
4. **Modulation notes:** How to shift energy if needed

## Example Applications

### Situation: Interview going flat

**Problem:** Prepared questions are getting prepared answers
**Thread:** Notice they keep mentioning "when I was starting out" - there's something unresolved there
**Build:** "You keep going back to the beginning. Is there something about starting that still matters to you now?"
**Result:** They open up about imposter syndrome they still carry

### Situation: Guest is guarded

**Problem:** Short answers, professional demeanor, no vulnerability
**Energy match:** Be equally composed - don't try to force intimacy
**Thread:** Find something you genuinely have in common (even small)
**Build:** Share your own vulnerability first, briefly
**Result:** Permission for them to drop the guard

### Situation: Conversation is too chaotic

**Problem:** They're all over the place, hard to follow
**Energy modulation:** Slow down your responses, add pauses
**Thread:** Find the through-line they're circling around
**Build:** "It sounds like all of this connects to control - or the lack of it. Does that feel right?"
**Result:** They focus, having been given a frame

## The Collaboration Spectrum

| Interrogation | Conversation | Collaboration |
|---------------|--------------|---------------|
| You lead, they answer | You both contribute | You build together |
| Predetermined destination | Flexible direction | Emergent destination |
| Information extraction | Information exchange | Meaning creation |
| "What happened?" | "How did that feel?" | "So when you said... were you also feeling...?" |

## Common Mistakes

1. **Waiting to talk instead of listening** - You're not looking for an opening; you're looking for a thread
2. **Sticking to the plan** - Your questions are a fallback, not a requirement
3. **Not building** - "That's interesting" is not building; it's a dead end
4. **Energy mismatch** - Being high-energy with someone reflective makes them retreat
5. **Forcing vulnerability** - Vulnerability emerges; it can't be extracted
6. **Abandoning tangents too quickly** - The tangent often IS the conversation

## Questions That Collaborate

| Extraction Questions | Collaboration Questions |
|---------------------|------------------------|
| "Tell me about your childhood" | "You mentioned your kitchen - what happened there?" |
| "What's your creative process?" | "When you hit the wall, what does the voice in your head say?" |
| "What advice would you give?" | "What do you wish someone had told you that you had to learn the hard way?" |

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Conversation feels emergent, not scripted
- [ ] Both parties discover something unexpected
- [ ] Energy was matched and modulated appropriately
- [ ] Threads were followed rather than questions ticked off
- [ ] Tangents were allowed to develop
- [ ] Building happened rather than just acknowledging
