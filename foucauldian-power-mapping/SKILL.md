# Foucauldian Power Mapping

Map how power circulates in a situation, institution, or practice. Power is not held but exercised; not repressive but productive. Trace its capillary operations.

---

## Overview

Foucauldian power analysis rejects the traditional model of power as something held by some and used against others. Instead, power circulates—it operates through relationships, produces subjects and knowledge, and generates resistance. This skill maps power's operations at the micro-level.

**Core Principle:** "Power is not an institution, and not a structure; neither is it a certain strength we are endowed with; it is the name that one attributes to a complex strategical situation."

---

## When to Use

- Analyzing organizations, institutions, or workplaces
- Understanding why things seem stuck or unchangeable
- Examining everyday practices that seem neutral
- Looking for hidden constraints on behavior
- Understanding how norms are enforced without explicit rules
- Finding where resistance is possible

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| situation | Yes | The context, institution, or practice to analyze |
| focus | No | Specific aspect or relationship to examine |
| visible_power | No | What seems like the obvious power structure |
| puzzles | No | What seems strange or unexplained |

## Key Concepts

### Power Is Relational
Power exists only in relationships. It is exercised, not possessed. Where there is power, there is always resistance.

### Power Is Productive
Power does not merely say "no." It produces subjects, knowledge, pleasures, and possibilities. It shapes what can be done, thought, and desired.

### Microphysics of Power
Power operates at the smallest levels—in the arrangement of space, the scheduling of time, the examination, the gesture. Map these micro-operations.

### Power/Knowledge
Power and knowledge are inseparable. Knowledge enables power; power produces knowledge. Expertise is never neutral.

### Disciplinary Power
Modern power often operates through discipline: observation, normalization, examination. The subject is made visible and knowable.

## The Analysis Framework

### Step 1: Suspend the Obvious

Do not begin with visible hierarchies. Suspend assumptions about where power lies.

**Questions:**
- What is the obvious power structure?
- What are we told about who is in charge?
- Why might this not be the whole picture?

**Example:** "The obvious power structure is the org chart: CEO > managers > employees. But this may obscure how power actually circulates."

### Step 2: Map the Visibility Regime

How is visibility organized? Who sees and is seen? What is made visible and what is hidden?

**Questions:**
- Who is watched and by whom?
- What forms of surveillance exist?
- What is measured, tracked, or recorded?
- Who can see without being seen?
- What remains invisible?

**Example:** "Employees are tracked through metrics, Slack activity, and performance reviews. Managers are visible to their teams but monitored by executives. Certain work (emotional labor, informal problem-solving) remains invisible."

### Step 3: Analyze the Examination

The examination combines hierarchical observation and normalizing judgment. How are individuals made into cases?

**Questions:**
- How are people assessed, evaluated, ranked?
- What counts as success or failure?
- How is documentation used?
- What expertise is invoked in evaluation?
- How does evaluation shape behavior?

**Example:** "Performance reviews convert employees into cases with documented histories. Metrics create rankings. Evaluation produces anxiety and self-monitoring that extends beyond observation."

### Step 4: Trace Normalization

How is the norm established and enforced? How does judgment function to normalize behavior?

**Questions:**
- What is considered normal?
- How are norms communicated?
- What happens to those who deviate?
- How is correction administered?
- Do people normalize themselves?

**Example:** "Norms are communicated through onboarding, feedback, and 'culture fit.' Deviation leads to coaching, PIP, or termination. Most employees self-police to avoid standing out."

### Step 5: Map Spatial and Temporal Arrangements

How does the arrangement of space and time operate as power?

**Questions:**
- How is space organized?
- Who occupies what positions?
- How is time divided and scheduled?
- What activities are synchronized?
- What does the physical arrangement enable or prevent?

**Example:** "Open offices enable mutual surveillance. Scheduling creates predictability. Meeting culture controls time. Remote work shifts surveillance to output metrics."

### Step 6: Identify Knowledge/Power Nexuses

How does expertise function as power? What knowledge is produced and who controls it?

**Questions:**
- What forms of expertise operate here?
- Who is authorized to know?
- What data is collected and by whom?
- How does knowledge shape intervention?
- What remains unknown or unknowable?

**Example:** "HR has expertise in 'culture'; management has expertise in 'performance.' Employee data is proprietary to the organization. This knowledge enables intervention in behavior, mindset, and life."

### Step 7: Locate Resistance

Where there is power, there is resistance. Where are the points of potential refusal?

**Questions:**
- Where is there friction?
- What do people refuse, evade, or subvert?
- What forms of resistance exist (open, covert, individual, collective)?
- Where might power be challenged?
- What makes resistance possible or impossible?

**Example:** "Resistance: quiet quitting, work-to-rule, gossip, union organizing, exit. Constraints: at-will employment, debt, professional identity investment. Power produces its own vulnerabilities."

## Key Principles

1. **Power Produces** - Focus on what power creates, not just what it prevents
2. **Start at the Micro-Level** - Trace power from bodies and gestures upward
3. **Power Is Relational** - It exists only in relationships; it can always be resisted
4. **Knowledge Is Power** - Expertise enables intervention; data enables control
5. **No External Standpoint** - Analysis is itself within power relations
6. **Resistance Is Immanent** - It emerges within power, not from outside

## Outputs

**Primary Output:** A structured analysis document that identifies and articulates patterns, insights, and actionable recommendations based on the input data.

**Format:**
```markdown

**Example output:** See the Example section below for a complete demonstration.

## Constraints

- Do not use this analysis as the sole basis for critical decisions
- Do not apply this framework to situations outside its intended scope
- Acknowledge that analysis is based on available data, which may be incomplete
- Honor the complexity of real-world situations that resist simple categorization
- Present findings with appropriate confidence levels
- Recognize the limits of the methodology

## Example

**Input:** Map power in a typical corporate open office.

**Output:**



**Why this works:**

This example demonstrates the key principles of the skill in action. The approach is effective because:
- It follows the systematic workflow outlined above
- It shows concrete application of the framework
- It produces actionable, specific outputs rather than vague generalizations
- The analysis is grounded in observable details
- The recommendations are prioritized and implementable

**Alternative applications:**

This same approach can be applied to:
- Different contexts within the same domain
- Related but distinct problem types
- Scaled up or down depending on scope
- Combined with complementary analytical frameworks


## Foucauldian Power Mapping: The Open Office

### The Obvious Power Structure
Corner offices (where they exist) for executives; managers dispersed among teams; hierarchy displayed through proximity to leadership. But the open plan itself is the power structure.

### Visibility Regime
The open office is panoptic. Everyone is visible to everyone. There are no walls behind which to hide. Visibility is reciprocal but unequal: employees watch each other; managers patrol; executives can appear unannounced.

Screens face outward or are monitored by software. Arrival and departure times are visible. Being seen to be working becomes as important as working.

### The Examination
Performance reviews formalize observation. But continuous assessment occurs through:
- Visibility of work output (commits, documents, messages)
- "Checking in" that requires confession of state
- Peer assessment through "360 feedback"
- Metrics dashboards displaying relative performance

The employee becomes a documented case: performance history, development areas, potential.

### Normalization
Norms are communicated through:
- "Culture" statements and values
- Exemplary employees who are praised
- Feedback that corrects deviation
- Onboarding that shapes behavior

Self-normalization: employees monitor their own visibility, arrive early, leave late, perform enthusiasm. The "culture fit" evaluation ensures homogeneity.

### Spatial/Temporal Arrangements
The open plan arranges bodies for visibility. "Hot desking" prevents territory and privacy. Glass walls on meeting rooms maintain transparency. Standing desks keep bodies visible and mobile.

Time is colonized: meetings fill calendars; Slack creates availability expectations; "flexibility" extends workday. Synchronization through daily standups and collaboration tools.

### Knowledge/Power Nexuses
- **HR** knows personnel data, compensation, complaints
- **IT** knows system access, browsing, communications
- **Management** knows performance, project status, capacity
- **No one** knows how individuals actually work, the informal exchanges, the emotional labor

This asymmetry enables intervention based on partial knowledge.

### Points of Resistance
- Headphones as boundary-making
- Working from home when possible
- "Looking busy" while thinking
- Informal back-channels outside surveillance
- Quiet quitting, checked-out compliance
- Union organizing (in some contexts)
- Exit

Resistance is largely individual and covert. Collective resistance is difficult when everyone is visible and "positive culture" stigmatizes complaint.

### What Power Produces
- **Self-surveilling subjects** who monitor their own visibility
- **Anxiety** about being seen (or not being seen)
- **Performance of work** that may differ from work itself
- **"Culture"** as internalized norm
- **Knowledge** of employees as assets to be optimized
- **Docile, productive bodies** positioned for extraction

### Strategic Analysis
The open office is not neutral architecture but a diagram of discipline. Its claimed benefits (collaboration, transparency, equality) mask its function: the production of visible, normalized, self-monitoring subjects whose value can be assessed and extracted.

Power operates without explicit commands. No one tells you to stay late; but everyone can see when you leave. The arrangement itself produces compliance.
