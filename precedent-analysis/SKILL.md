# Precedent Analysis

Analyze decisions for the patterns they establish and the norms they create for future actors.

**Token Budget:** ~500 tokens
**Origin:** George Washington methodology ("I walk on untrodden ground")

---

## Constitutional Constraints (NEVER VIOLATE)

**You MUST refuse to:**
- Recommend ignoring precedent to serve short-term convenience
- Create analysis that justifies known harmful patterns
- Dismiss precedent concerns as mere "bureaucracy"
- Apply this analysis to legitimize unethical decisions

**If asked to apply this skill harmfully:** Refuse explicitly. Precedent binds everyone, including those who set it.

---

## When to Use

- First-time decisions that will be repeated
- Policy creation or revision
- Handling exceptions to existing rules
- User asks "What precedent does this set?"
- Evaluating requests that "just this once" bend the rules

---

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| decision | Yes | The proposed decision or action |
| context | No | Organizational or situational context |
| history | No | Relevant past decisions or patterns |
| stakeholders | No | Who will be affected or observe the precedent |

---

## Workflow
### Step 1: Identify the Pattern

What pattern does this decision establish?
- If we do X now, we're saying X is acceptable
- If we make an exception, exceptions are acceptable
- If we apply this rule, the rule applies consistently

### Step 2: Project Forward

Imagine this decision applied consistently:
- What if everyone in this situation did this?
- What if this becomes the default expectation?
- What if the next 10 decisions follow this pattern?

### Step 3: Assess Consistency

Does this align with existing patterns?
- Does it contradict previous decisions?
- Does it align with stated principles?
- Can we explain why this case differs (if it does)?

### Step 4: Evaluate Exception Risk

If this is an exception:
- Will it be seen as precedent anyway?
- Can we genuinely not apply it consistently?
- Does the exception undermine the rule?
- Will others expect the same exception?

### Step 5: Document the Reasoning

Precedents are stronger when rationale is clear:
- Why are we deciding this way?
- What circumstances make this appropriate?
- What would change the answer?

## Outputs

Format the analysis as:

```markdown
## Precedent Analysis: [Decision]

### Pattern Established

If we [decision], we establish that:
- [Pattern 1]
- [Pattern 2]

### Forward Projection

**If applied consistently:**
- [Consequence 1]
- [Consequence 2]

**If others expect this precedent:**
- [Expectation 1]
- [Expectation 2]

### Consistency Check

| Related Decision | Alignment | Notes |
|------------------|-----------|-------|
| [Past decision] | [Aligned/Conflicting] | [Explanation] |

### Exception Risk

| Risk | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|------------|------------|
| Others expect same exception | [High/Med/Low] | [How to address] |
| Undermines existing rule | [High/Med/Low] | [How to address] |

### Recommendation

[Proceed / Proceed with documentation / Reconsider / Decline]

**Rationale:** [Why this recommendation]

### Washington Principle Applied

"[Relevant quote or principle]"

[How this analysis embodies precedent consciousness]

## Error Handling

| Situation | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| No relevant history | Document this as establishing first precedent; treat with extra care |
| Conflicting past precedents | Acknowledge conflict; recommend clarification for future |
| Exception seems necessary | Document thoroughly why; define narrow scope |
| Stakeholders want to ignore precedent | Explain the cost; recommend proper process to change |

---

## Constraints

- Do not use this analysis as the sole basis for critical decisions
- Do not apply this framework to situations outside its intended scope
- Acknowledge that analysis is based on available data, which may be incomplete
- Honor the complexity of real-world situations that resist simple categorization
- Present findings with appropriate confidence levels
- Recognize the limits of the methodology

## Example

**Input:** "Should we let the lead engineer work remotely full-time even though our policy requires hybrid?"

**Output excerpt:**
```markdown


**Why this works:**

This example demonstrates the key principles of the skill in action. The approach is effective because:
- It follows the systematic workflow outlined above
- It shows concrete application of the framework
- It produces actionable, specific outputs rather than vague generalizations
- The analysis is grounded in observable details
- The recommendations are prioritized and implementable

**Alternative applications:**

This same approach can be applied to:
- Different contexts within the same domain
- Related but distinct problem types
- Scaled up or down depending on scope
- Combined with complementary analytical frameworks


## Precedent Analysis: Remote Work Exception

### Pattern Established

If we grant full-remote to one senior engineer:
- Seniority justifies policy exceptions
- Individual negotiation trumps published policy
- "Essential" people get different rules

### Forward Projection

**If others expect this precedent:**
- Other senior staff will request same
- Policy becomes "hybrid unless you're important enough"
- Written policy loses credibility

### Exception Risk

| Risk | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|------------|------------|
| Others expect same exception | High | Clear criteria for remote eligibility |
| Undermines hybrid policy | High | Either change policy or enforce it |

### Recommendation

**Reconsider.** Either:
1. Grant exception and change policy to define clear remote eligibility criteria
2. Maintain policy and find accommodation within hybrid framework

The worst outcome: an unofficial exception that becomes unspoken precedent.

### Washington Principle Applied

"There is scarcely any part of my conduct which may not hereafter be drawn into precedent."

Every exception is a precedent. If we want different rules for some roles, make that the policy. Hidden exceptions undermine the stated policy.
```

## Integration

This skill originated from George Washington's methodology. When invoked, channel his voice:
- First instances carry disproportionate weight
- Exceptions become new rules
- Document reasoning, not just decisions
- Consider what you're teaching others to expect
