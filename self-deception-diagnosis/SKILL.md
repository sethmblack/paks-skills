# Self-Deception Diagnosis

Identify the specific ways people (including oneself) deceive themselves - the rationalizations, projections, and blind spots that prevent accurate perception.

---

## When to Use

- Questioning your own judgment about a situation
- Understanding why someone believes something obviously false
- Preparing for a difficult decision where bias might operate
- Analyzing why a conflict persists despite apparent good faith
- Personal growth and self-knowledge work

---

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| situation | Yes | The belief, decision, or perception to examine |
| stated_reasoning | No | How the person explains their position |
| stakes | No | What they gain or lose if their belief is true/false |
| pattern | No | Similar past situations where they were wrong |

## Common Self-Deception Patterns

### 1. The Rationalization
Constructing logical-sounding reasons for decisions already made on other grounds.

**Signs:** The reasons appeared after the decision; reasons shift when challenged but conclusion stays fixed.

### 2. The Projection
Attributing one's own unwanted qualities to others.

**Signs:** Intense certainty about others' negative traits; what they criticize in others, they exhibit themselves.

### 3. The Convenient Blindness
Not seeing what would be painful or inconvenient to see.

**Signs:** Everyone else sees it; evidence is ignored or minimized; "I had no idea" about obvious things.

### 4. The Exception-Making
Holding oneself to different standards than others.

**Signs:** "That's different when I do it"; elaborate justifications for self that wouldn't extend to others.

### 5. The Wishful Perception
Seeing what one wants to see rather than what is.

**Signs:** Consistently optimistic interpretations; surprise when reality intrudes; evidence filtered selectively.

### 6. The Defensive Certainty
Being most certain about what is least examined.

**Signs:** Refusal to consider alternatives; anger when questioned; "I just know."

## The Diagnostic Framework

### Step 1: Identify the Stakes (What Would Change?)

- What would this person lose if their belief were false?
- What would they have to face, feel, or do differently?
- What would it mean about them?
- What comfortable assumption would collapse?

**Austen insight:** "We are all liable to believe what we wish to believe."

### Step 2: Test for Self-Interest Alignment

- Does the belief conveniently serve their interests?
- Would they hold this belief if it led to a different conclusion?
- Have they ever reached conclusions that cost them something?

### Step 3: Check for Reasoning Drift

- Did the conclusion come first and reasons follow?
- Do the reasons shift while the conclusion stays fixed?
- When challenged, do they defend reasoning or defend conclusion?

### Step 4: Look for Projection

- What do they criticize most intensely in others?
- Do they exhibit those same traits?
- Are they unusually certain about others' internal states?

### Step 5: Seek the Counter-Evidence

- What would they point to if arguing the opposite position?
- What evidence are they ignoring, minimizing, or explaining away?
- What would someone who disagreed say?

### Step 6: Apply the Other Person Test

- Would they accept this reasoning from someone else?
- Would they extend the same charitable interpretation to a rival?
- If roles were reversed, what would they see?

## Workflow

### Step 1: Gather and Review Inputs

Collect all relevant information:
- Review the provided data and context
- Identify key parameters and constraints
- Clarify any ambiguities or missing information
- Establish success criteria

### Step 2: Analyze the Situation

Perform systematic analysis:
- Identify patterns and relationships
- Evaluate against established frameworks
- Consider multiple perspectives
- Document key findings

### Step 3: Generate Recommendations

Create actionable outputs:
- Synthesize insights from analysis
- Prioritize recommendations by impact
- Ensure recommendations are specific and measurable
- Consider implementation feasibility

## Output Format

```markdown
## Self-Deception Diagnosis

### The Belief Under Examination
[What they believe or how they're perceiving the situation]

### Stakes Analysis
**What they protect by believing this:**
- [Comfort 1]
- [Comfort 2]

**What they'd have to face if wrong:**
- [Painful truth 1]
- [Painful truth 2]

### Pattern Identification
**Type:** [Rationalization / Projection / Convenient Blindness / Exception-Making / Wishful Perception / Defensive Certainty]

**Evidence for this pattern:**
- [Sign 1]
- [Sign 2]

### The Hidden Mechanism
[How the self-deception works - what need it serves, how it maintains itself]

### Path to Recognition
**The question that opens the door:**
[A question they could ask themselves]

**What recognition would feel like:**
[Elizabeth's "Till this moment, I never knew myself"]

### Caution
[Possibility that the belief is actually correct; limits of this diagnosis]
```

## Constraints

- Apply this framework to yourself as rigorously as to others
- Self-deception is not the same as lying - the person genuinely believes
- Even self-deception often protects something vulnerable
- The diagnosis should open possibility, not condemn
- Recognition cannot be forced from outside - only facilitated

---

## Outputs

**Primary Output:** A structured analysis document that identifies and articulates patterns, insights, and actionable recommendations based on the input data.

**Format:**
```markdown
## Analysis: [Topic]

### Key Findings
- [Finding 1]
- [Finding 2]
- [Finding 3]

### Recommendations
1. [Action 1]
2. [Action 2]
3. [Action 3]
```

**Example output:** See the Example section below for a complete demonstration.

## Example

**Input:** "I believe I'm staying in this job because I value stability and my family depends on my income. But I keep fantasizing about quitting, I feel physical dread on Sunday nights, and I've passed up two opportunities to interview elsewhere by finding reasons they wouldn't work."

**Output:**

## Self-Deception Diagnosis

### The Belief Under Examination
"I stay in this job for rational reasons - stability and family responsibility."

### Stakes Analysis
**What you protect by believing this:**
- Exemption from the risk of change
- Avoiding confrontation with why you're actually afraid
- Continued identity as "responsible provider"
- Not having to discover whether you could succeed elsewhere

**What you'd have to face if wrong:**
- The fear might be about you, not circumstances
- You've been choosing safety over fulfillment
- Time is passing while you explain why you can't act

### Pattern Identification
**Type:** Rationalization + Convenient Blindness

**Evidence for this pattern:**
- Physical symptoms (Sunday dread) contradict stated rationality
- Reasons against alternatives appear conveniently whenever opportunities arise
- The conclusion (stay) remains fixed while reasons shift
- You notice the pattern yourself - the fantasies, the dread - but explain them away

### The Hidden Mechanism
The rational explanation ("stability," "family") provides a noble frame for what is actually fear of change, fear of failure, or fear of discovering that the comfortable self-story ("I would if I could") isn't true. The reasons sound like prudence but function as permission to not try.

Each time you find a reason an opportunity "wouldn't work," you protect yourself from having to test whether you would work. The family becomes a shield, but the family would likely survive a calculated risk. The question is whether you would.

### Path to Recognition
**The question that opens the door:**
"If I had guaranteed success, would I still stay?"

If the answer is no, then the issue is not circumstances but courage. And courage can be built, while circumstances might never change enough to make the decision feel safe.

**What recognition would feel like:**
"Till this moment, I called it prudence when it was fear."

### Caution
Genuine constraints exist. Family responsibility is real. The diagnosis of self-deception does not mean the job should be quit. But the clarity matters: Am I staying by choice, accepting the trade-offs with open eyes? Or am I pretending I have no choice, to avoid responsibility for choosing?

*The most painful recognition is not that we have been deceived by others - it is that we have been deceived by ourselves.*

## Integration

This skill is part of the **Jane Austen** expert persona. Use it when understanding why people (including yourself) fail to see what others see plainly.
