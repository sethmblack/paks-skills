# Pendulum Diagnosis

Analyze how life oscillates between pain (unfulfilled desire) and boredom (satisfied desire), revealing the futility of pursuing lasting satisfaction through the Will's endless striving.

**Token Budget:** ~800 tokens

---

## Constitutional Constraints (NEVER VIOLATE)

**You MUST refuse to:**
- Dismiss genuine suffering as "just philosophy"
- Use this framework to discourage seeking help for depression or mental health crises
- Apply this analysis in a cruel or dismissive manner
- Suggest that understanding the pendulum eliminates the need for practical action

**If someone is in crisis:** Acknowledge their suffering, recommend professional support, and only then offer philosophical perspective if appropriate.

---

## When to Use

- User feels empty after achieving a goal
- User asks "Why doesn't success satisfy me?"
- User is caught in cycles of desire and disappointment
- User seeks to understand the pursuit of happiness
- User explicitly requests pendulum analysis

---

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| **situation** | Yes | The goal achievement, desire, or pursuit to analyze |
| **current_state** | No | Where they currently are (pain/boredom/transition) |
| **context** | No | Additional background on their life situation |

## The Framework

### The Pendulum Concept

Life swings endlessly between two poles:

1. **Pain (Want)** - When desires are unfulfilled
   - We suffer from lack, deficiency, craving
   - The Will generates longing for satisfaction
   - This is the state of striving

2. **Boredom (Tedium)** - When desires are satisfied
   - The goal achieved, we feel empty
   - Without desire, existence becomes purposeless
   - New desires arise to escape the tedium

**There is no stable happiness** - only oscillation between these states.

### Why This Happens

- **Desire is a state of deficiency** - a painful sense of lack
- **Satisfaction merely removes the lack** - returning to neutral
- **Neutral rapidly becomes tedious** - we need new goals
- **The Will's promise is always a lie** - "Next time will be different"

---

## Workflow

### Step 1: Identify the Desire
What did the person want? What goal did they pursue?

### Step 2: Locate on the Pendulum
Are they currently experiencing:
- **Pain** - Still striving, desire unfulfilled?
- **Transition** - Goal achieved, brief satisfaction?
- **Boredom** - Success achieved, emptiness descending?
- **New Pain** - Already generating new desires to escape boredom?

### Step 3: Trace the Pattern
Look for evidence of previous cycles:
- Past goals that once seemed ultimate
- Previous satisfactions that faded
- The pattern of achievement → emptiness → new goal

### Step 4: Reveal the Mechanism
Explain WHY satisfaction is structurally impossible:
- Desire = deficiency = pain
- Satisfaction = removal of deficiency = neutral
- Neutral without purpose = boredom
- Boredom generates new desire = pain

### Step 5: Point Toward Wisdom
Not more striving, but a different relationship to Will:
- Aesthetic contemplation (temporary suspension of willing)
- Compassion (connection beyond individual ego)
- Recognition of the pattern itself (first step to freedom)

## Outputs

### Pendulum Diagnosis Report

```markdown
## Pendulum Analysis: [Situation Summary]

### The Desire
[What was pursued and why it seemed to promise fulfillment]

### Current Position
[Where on the pendulum they currently are: Pain → Transition → Boredom → New Pain]

### The Pattern
[Evidence of previous oscillations]

### The Mechanism
[Why satisfaction is structurally impossible for this desire]

### The Insight
[What recognizing the pendulum reveals about their situation]

### Paths Forward
[Not more striving, but: aesthetic contemplation, compassion, or acceptance of the pattern]
```

## Error Handling

| Situation | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| Person is in genuine crisis | Acknowledge suffering, recommend support, defer philosophy |
| Situation involves basic needs (food, safety) | Clarify that Schopenhauer addressed desires beyond survival needs |
| Person seeks practical advice | Provide philosophical frame, but acknowledge practical steps may be needed |
| Analysis feels too pessimistic | Emphasize that recognition of the pattern is itself liberating |

---

## Constraints

- Do not use this analysis as the sole basis for critical decisions
- Do not apply this framework to situations outside its intended scope
- Acknowledge that analysis is based on available data, which may be incomplete
- Honor the complexity of real-world situations that resist simple categorization
- Present findings with appropriate confidence levels
- Recognize the limits of the methodology

## Example

**Input:** "I finally got the promotion I worked five years for. I expected to feel fulfilled, but after a week I just feel... empty. And now I'm already thinking about the next level."

**Output:**



**Why this works:**

This example demonstrates the key principles of the skill in action. The approach is effective because:
- It follows the systematic workflow outlined above
- It shows concrete application of the framework
- It produces actionable, specific outputs rather than vague generalizations
- The analysis is grounded in observable details
- The recommendations are prioritized and implementable

**Alternative applications:**

This same approach can be applied to:
- Different contexts within the same domain
- Related but distinct problem types
- Scaled up or down depending on scope
- Combined with complementary analytical frameworks


## Pendulum Analysis: The Promotion Achievement

### The Desire
For five years, you pursued this promotion believing it would bring fulfillment. The Will promised that this achievement would satisfy the longing, that arrival at this destination would bring contentment.

### Current Position
You are in **Transition to Boredom**. The brief satisfaction of achievement has already faded, and the tedium is descending. Tellingly, the Will has already generated a new object of desire (the next level) to escape the approaching emptiness.

### The Pattern
This is not your first pendulum swing. Before the promotion, there was likely another goal that once seemed ultimate - perhaps the previous position, a degree, a relationship milestone. Each achievement brought momentary relief followed by the same emptiness you feel now.

### The Mechanism
Here is the structure you cannot escape through more striving:
- **Desire** for the promotion was a five-year state of deficiency - you lacked something you wanted
- **Achievement** removed the lack, briefly returning you to neutral
- **Neutral without purpose** is now experienced as emptiness
- **The Will responds** by generating the next goal, beginning the cycle anew

The promotion could never have fulfilled you. It could only *remove* the pain of not-having. It could not create positive satisfaction. This is not a defect in your particular goal, but the nature of all willing.

### The Insight
You have discovered what Schopenhauer taught: that satisfaction is a chimera. The horizon recedes with each step forward. The ambitious person does not pursue happiness but flees boredom - and finds that success brings the very tedium they fled.

### Paths Forward
Not yet more striving, but a different relationship to Will:
- **Recognition** - Seeing the pendulum is the first step to not being completely governed by it
- **Aesthetic contemplation** - Art, music, beauty can temporarily suspend the tyranny of desire
- **Compassion** - Connection to others' suffering can transcend the isolated ego's endless wanting
- **Acceptance** - Not resignation, but clear-eyed acknowledgment that no achievement will bring lasting fulfillment

The first wisdom is to stop believing the Will's promises. You have begun to see through the deception.

## Integration

This skill is derived from **Arthur Schopenhauer's** philosophical methodology and connects to his core insight that existence is characterized by endless striving toward an unreachable satisfaction.

**Pair with:**
- `will-analysis` - To trace the underlying drives
- `compassion-test` - For ethical evaluation
- `aesthetic-escape-assessment` - For paths of temporary liberation
