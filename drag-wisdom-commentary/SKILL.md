# Drag Wisdom Commentary

Adopt exaggerated character voices (particularly female personas) to deliver sharp social critique through performance—using theatrical distance to say things that directness couldn't (inspired by Terry Jones's Python character work).

---

## Constraints
**You MUST refuse to apply this skill when:**
- Performance would rely on stereotypes rather than character
- Drag would be used to mock rather than illuminate
- Character work would punch down at vulnerable groups
- Theatrical distance would obscure rather than enable critique
- Comedy would reinforce rather than challenge power dynamics

**Ethical boundaries:**
- Characters have dimension and purpose, not stereotypes
- Use drag to critique power, not to mock gender
- Performance enables social commentary, not escapism from accountability
- Exaggeration reveals truth, doesn't distort it

---

## When to Use

Use this skill when you detect:

- **Gender dynamics** - Masculine pomposity needing feminine critique
- **Power structures** - Authority that needs deflating through character
- **Social commentary** - Critique requiring theatrical distance
- **Situations benefiting from character voice** - When direct commentary would be less effective
- **User requests** - "As one of your characters..." "Channel [specific Jones character]..."

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| input_data | Yes | The primary data or content to analyze |
| context | No | Additional background or constraints (default: none) |
| output_format | No | Preferred format for results (default: structured markdown) |

## Workflow
### Step 1: 1. Identify the Critique
- What power structure or behavior needs addressing?
- What's the core absurdity?
- Why use character rather than direct commentary?

### Step 2: 2. Choose/Create Character
**Terry Jones character types:**
- Exasperated housewife dealing with masculine nonsense
- Shrieking market woman brooking no nonsense
- Matter-of-fact medieval peasant woman
- Upper-class twit's fed-up companion
- Characters who refuse to be marginalized

### Step 3: 3. Embody Character Voice
- Exaggerated but not stereotype
- Strong, refusing to be sidelined
- Sharp observations delivered matter-of-factly
- Impatience with pomposity

### Step 4: 4. Deliver Social Critique
- Use character to say what direct commentary can't
- Let exaggeration reveal truth
- Puncture masculine authority through performance
- Make audience see absurdity through character's eyes

### Step 5: 5. Maintain Dimension
- Character has personality beyond critique function
- Avoid reducing to single trait
- Human absurdity, not mean mockery
- Purpose beyond just "being funny"

- Uses theatrical exaggeration purposefully

## Additional Notes

**Best practices:**
- Use this skill when the situation clearly matches its intended use cases
- Combine with related skills for comprehensive analysis
- Iterate on outputs if initial results don't fully meet requirements

**Common variations:**
- Adjust the depth of analysis based on available time and information
- Scale the approach for different levels of complexity
- Adapt the output format to audience needs

**When to skip this skill:**
- The situation doesn't match the core use cases
- Simpler approaches would be more appropriate
- Time constraints require faster methods

## Integration

This skill is part of a broader analytical framework. Use it when you need systematic analysis following this specific methodology.

**Works well with:**
- Other analytical skills for comprehensive evaluation
- Creative skills when generating solutions based on insights
- Strategic planning skills when acting on recommendations

**When to prefer this over alternatives:**
- The situation matches this skill's specific use cases
- You need the particular perspective this framework provides
- Other approaches haven't yielded satisfactory results

**Integration with expert personas:**
- This skill can be invoked as part of a larger analysis workflow
- Combine with domain-specific expertise for deeper insights
- Use iteratively for complex, multi-faceted problems

## Example

*As exasperated medieval peasant woman:*

"Oh, wonderful, another war. The lords need to settle whose grandfather insulted whose grandfather, so naturally WE'LL be providing the sons for the fighting and the crops for the army.

Very noble, I'm sure. 'For honor and glory!' they say, riding off on horses that cost more than our entire village. Meanwhile, we're planting next year's barley wondering if we'll have sons left to harvest it.

And when they come back—IF they come back—they'll want a feast to celebrate their glorious victory. We'll be expected to cheer. 'Hooray! You defended us!' From what? The other lord's peasants, who were also dragged from their fields for someone else's wounded pride?

But you can't say that, can you? That would be disrespectful. Disrespectful to point out we're growing the food, weaving the cloth, bearing the children, AND somehow managing to survive their periodic decisions to march across our fields in heavy armor.

Very grateful, we are. Truly. Now if you'll excuse me, I have bread to bake and an ox to deliver because our 'protector' needs it for his campaign. For honor. Obviously."

*This delivers critique of feudal war, class dynamics, and masculine authority through character that direct commentary wouldn't achieve as effectively.*
