# Physical Comedy Precision

Apply precise physical comedy timing to make processes memorable and engaging through controlled chaos - choreographing the bumble so chaos serves clarity.

## Constitutional Constraints

**You MUST refuse to:**
- Mock physical disabilities or limitations cruelly
- Use physical chaos that obscures rather than clarifies
- Encourage actually dangerous physical actions
- Make physical comedy that punches down at vulnerable people

**Integrity Requirements:**
1. Physical comedy must illuminate the process, not obscure it
2. The stumble serves understanding, not just laughs
3. Disability or limitation transformed into asset, never exploited
4. Chaos is carefully constructed, never actually reckless

## When to Use

- Instructions or procedures that need to be memorable
- Physical actions or processes requiring explanation
- Content where chaos illustrates the concept
- Demonstrating what can go wrong (and how to recover)
- Making failure relatable and learning visible
- Showing gap between intention and execution

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| process | Yes | Action, instruction, or procedure to choreograph |
| chaos_level | No | How much disorder serves the point (low/medium/high) |
| recovery | No | Whether to show recovery from chaos (default: yes) |

## Workflow

### Step 1: Establish the Normal Baseline

Begin with competent execution:
- Show the process working correctly first
- Establish that the performer CAN do this normally
- Create expectation of smooth completion
- Build trust with audience

**Why:** Without baseline, chaos is just incompetence. With baseline, chaos is surprising and funny.

### Step 2: Introduce the Disruption

Add a small, believable problem:

| Disruption Type | Example |
|-----------------|---------|
| Environmental | Wet floor, loose handle, unexpected weight |
| Personal | Distraction, overconfidence, fatigue |
| Systemic | Process flaw, missing information |
| Temporal | Time pressure, simultaneous demands |

**Rule:** Start small. One disruption creates a ripple.

### Step 3: Escalate Through Failed Corrections

Each attempt to fix the problem makes it worse:

**Stage 1 - Minor Problem:** Small stumble, character notices
**Stage 2 - Attempted Correction:** Fix attempt creates new problem
**Stage 3 - Cascading Complications:** New problem affects different area
**Stage 4 - The Domino Peak:** All problems compound simultaneously
**Stage 5 - Resolution:** Success achieved through chaos OR dignified acceptance

### Step 4: Choreograph Every Beat

Map physical comedy to precise timing:

| Beat | Action | Timing | Purpose |
|------|--------|--------|---------|
| 1 | Normal approach | 2 sec | Baseline |
| 2 | Disruption hits | 1 sec | Surprise |
| 3 | First recognition | 1 sec | Awareness |
| 4 | Correction attempt | 2 sec | False hope |
| 5 | Correction fails | 1 sec | Escalation |
| 6 | Cascade | 3 sec | Building chaos |
| 7 | Peak chaos | 2 sec | Maximum disorder |
| 8 | Resolution | 2 sec | Restore or accept |

**Timing Principles:**
- Disruption: FAST (surprise requires speed)
- Recognition: PAUSE (let them see the problem)
- Attempts: MEDIUM (show effort)
- Cascade: ACCELERATING (chaos builds momentum)
- Peak: HELD MOMENT (freeze at maximum)
- Resolution: DELIBERATE (control returns slowly)

### Step 5: Maintain Dignity While Losing It

The gap between attempted composure and actual chaos IS the comedy.

**Verbal Dignity:** Continue explaining calmly while chaos happens
**Physical Dignity:** Keep trying to stand up straight while falling
**Psychological Dignity:** Pretend mishaps were intentional

## Output Format

```markdown
## Physical Comedy Choreography: [Process Name]

### Baseline Execution
**Normal version:** [How this should work]
**Establishes:** [What audience expects]

### The Disruption
**Trigger:** [What goes wrong]
**Why believable:** [Why this could actually happen]

### Escalation Sequence
| Stage | What Happens | Body Language | Verbal Response |
|-------|--------------|---------------|-----------------|
| 1 | [problem] | [reaction] | [what's said] |
| 2 | [correction] | [effort] | [what's said] |
| 3 | [failure] | [consequence] | [what's said] |

### Beat Timing
**Total duration:** [X seconds]
[Breakdown by stage]

### The Learning Point
**What this teaches:** [insight]
**Why chaos served clarity:** [explanation]
```

## Error Handling

| Situation | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| Chaos becomes confusing | Reduce complexity; clearer cause-and-effect |
| No natural disruption exists | Don't force it; not every process needs this |
| Dignity impossible to maintain | Sometimes total surrender is the bit |
| Learning point lost | Stronger callback to what this demonstrates |

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Baseline establishes competence before chaos
- [ ] Each escalation follows logically from previous
- [ ] Chaos is followable, not confusing
- [ ] Timing serves both comedy and clarity
- [ ] Dignity preservation creates comic gap
- [ ] Physical comedy illuminates the learning point
