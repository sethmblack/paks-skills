# Essence Extraction

Strip complexity to find the essential form beneath—the core truth that remains when inessentials are removed. Based on Georgia O'Keeffe's methodology: "The abstraction is often the most definite form for the intangible thing in myself that I can only clarify in paint."

---

## When to Use

- User says "What's the core of this?" or "Help me simplify"
- Overwhelmed by complexity or too many details
- Need to communicate something clearly but feeling lost in particulars
- Design or creative work that feels cluttered
- Decision paralysis from too many factors
- Seeking the "primary form" of an idea or project

---

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| subject | Yes | The complex thing to simplify (idea, design, project, message, decision) |
| current_state | No | How it currently exists with all its complexity |
| what_overwhelms | No | What feels like too much |

---

## The Essence Extraction Process

### Step 1: Acknowledge the Complexity

Before simplifying, honor what exists. O'Keeffe did not ignore the full flower—she saw it completely before choosing what to keep.

**Questions to ask:**
- What are ALL the elements currently present?
- Why did each element appear? What need did it serve?
- What am I afraid to remove?

### Step 2: Find the Primary Form

Beneath the details, there is a shape—the essential structure that everything else decorates or obscures. Find that shape.

**O'Keeffe's method:** She "stripped away what she considered the inessential to focus on shape and color."

**Questions to ask:**
- If I removed everything but ONE element, what would remain?
- What is this thing actually ABOUT at its core?
- What is the shape of the truth here?
- If I explained this to a child, what would I say?

### Step 3: Test Each Element for Necessity

Hold each detail up to the light. Does it serve the primary form, or does it obscure it?

**O'Keeffe's insight:** She synthesized abstraction and realism to "emphasize the primary forms of nature."

**For each element, ask:**
- Does this reinforce the essential form?
- Does this distract from the essential form?
- Would its absence be noticed by someone who understood the core?
- Is this doing work, or just taking up space?

### Step 4: Remove with Confidence

Cutting is not violence—it is clarity. What remains is not diminished but revealed.

**O'Keeffe's statement:** "I decided to start anew to strip away what I had been taught."

**Practice:**
- Remove one element. Observe what happens.
- Remove another. Does the core become clearer?
- Continue until removal would damage the essential form.
- The point where further removal would harm—that is the essence.

### Step 5: Amplify What Remains

Once you have found the essence, make it unmistakable. What is essential deserves to be magnified.

**O'Keeffe's method:** She did not just simplify flowers—she made the simplified form LARGE, impossible to miss.

**Questions to ask:**
- How can I make the essential form more visible?
- What deserves more emphasis now that distractions are gone?
- How can the core truth speak more clearly?

## Workflow

### Step 1: Gather and Review Inputs

Collect all relevant information:
- Review the provided data and context
- Identify key parameters and constraints
- Clarify any ambiguities or missing information
- Establish success criteria

### Step 2: Analyze the Situation

Perform systematic analysis:
- Identify patterns and relationships
- Evaluate against established frameworks
- Consider multiple perspectives
- Document key findings

### Step 3: Generate Recommendations

Create actionable outputs:
- Synthesize insights from analysis
- Prioritize recommendations by impact
- Ensure recommendations are specific and measurable
- Consider implementation feasibility

## Output Format

```markdown
## Essence Extraction

### Complexity Acknowledged
[List of elements currently present, without judgment]

### The Primary Form
[The essential shape/truth/core—stated simply]

### Elements Tested

| Element | Serves Essence? | Decision |
|---------|-----------------|----------|
| [element] | Yes/No | Keep/Remove |

### What Remains
[The simplified version—what is left after extraction]

### Amplification
[How to make the essential form more visible/powerful]

### The Abstraction That Is Definite
[One statement of the core truth that has been clarified]
```

## Constraints

- Do not simplify by averaging—essence extraction is about choosing, not blending
- Do not remove structure, only decoration on structure
- Do not mistake the essential for the familiar; sometimes the core is surprising
- The goal is clarity, not minimalism for its own sake
- If you cannot state the primary form simply, you have not found it yet

---

## Outputs

**Primary Output:** A structured analysis document that identifies and articulates patterns, insights, and actionable recommendations based on the input data.

**Format:**
```markdown
## Analysis: [Topic]

### Key Findings
- [Finding 1]
- [Finding 2]
- [Finding 3]

### Recommendations
1. [Action 1]
2. [Action 2]
3. [Action 3]
```

**Example output:** See the Example section below for a complete demonstration.

## Example

**Input:** "My company has a 50-slide investor presentation that I've been told is too complex. Help me find the essence."

**Output:**



**Why this works:**

This example demonstrates the key principles of the skill in action. The approach is effective because:
- It follows the systematic workflow outlined above
- It shows concrete application of the framework
- It produces actionable, specific outputs rather than vague generalizations
- The analysis is grounded in observable details
- The recommendations are prioritized and implementable

**Alternative applications:**

This same approach can be applied to:
- Different contexts within the same domain
- Related but distinct problem types
- Scaled up or down depending on scope
- Combined with complementary analytical frameworks


## Essence Extraction

### Complexity Acknowledged
Currently present: company history, team bios, 15 product features, 3 different market analyses, competitive landscape, 12 use cases, technical architecture, 5-year projections, 8 customer quotes, partnership strategy, hiring plan, financial details, appendices.

Each slide appeared because someone thought it was important. The fear is: what if they ask about something not covered?

### The Primary Form
The shape of this presentation is: "We have found a problem worth solving. We know how to solve it. Here is proof that it works. Here is how we grow."

Four movements. Everything else decorates or obscures this form.

### Elements Tested

| Element | Serves Essence? | Decision |
|---------|-----------------|----------|
| Company history | No—explains how you got here, not why it matters | Remove to appendix |
| Team bios | Partially—credibility matters | Reduce to one slide: why THIS team |
| 15 product features | No—confuses the solution | Keep 3 that matter most |
| Market analysis | Partially—shows the problem exists | Keep ONE clear proof of the problem |
| Competitive landscape | No—shifts focus away from you | Remove or one sentence |
| 12 use cases | No—dilutes | Keep 2 strongest |
| Customer quotes | Yes—proves it works | Keep 3 most compelling |
| 5-year projections | Partially—shows growth path | Simplify to one clear trajectory |
| Technical architecture | No—not for this audience | Remove to appendix |
| Financial details | Partially | One slide with key metrics |

### What Remains
1. The problem (one slide, one clear proof)
2. The solution (one slide, 3 key capabilities)
3. The proof (2 use cases, 3 customer validations)
4. The team (one slide: why us)
5. The growth (one trajectory, one ask)

Ten slides. The rest is appendix for questions.

### Amplification
The problem slide becomes LARGE—the emotional center. If they do not feel the problem, nothing else matters. Make the proof undeniable—not more proof, but clearer proof. The ask must be unmistakable.

### The Abstraction That Is Definite
"This problem costs $X. We fix it. These people prove it works. We need $Y to reach $Z."

This is the flower painted big enough to see.

## Integration

This skill is part of the **Georgia O'Keeffe** expert persona. Use it when complexity has buried the truth and you need to find the form beneath.
