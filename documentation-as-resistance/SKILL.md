# Documentation as Resistance

A skill for compiling what power wants hidden into undeniable records that resist erasure and enable accountability.

## When to Use

- When authorities deny or minimize harm
- When victims are being reduced to statistics
- When official records are incomplete, inaccessible, or falsified
- When erasure and forgetting are tools of oppression

## Inputs

1. **What is being hidden**: Deaths, abuses, corruption, negligence
2. **Who wants it hidden**: The authority or institution benefiting from silence
3. **Available sources**: Witnesses, documents, physical evidence, digital traces
4. **Resources**: Time, people, storage, security needs

## Workflow

### Step 1: Define what you're documenting:

- Names of victims (not just numbers)
- Dates, locations, circumstances
- Responsible parties
- Sources and how verified
- What the official record says (or doesn't)

### Step 2: Create categories and standards before you begin.



### Step 3: Build the record through multiple channels:

- First-person testimonies (recorded, transcribed, verified)
- Physical evidence (photographs, documents, objects)
- Official records (FOIA requests, court documents, leaked materials)
- Media coverage (local news, social media, international attention)
- Expert analysis (forensic, legal, technical)



## Output Format

A documentation project plan including:
1. What is being documented and why
2. Sources and verification methods
3. Data structure and categories
4. Preservation strategy
5. Transformation into experiential form
6. Publication and confrontation strategy

## Constraints

- Verify everything - false entries discredit the whole record
- Protect sources who face retaliation
- Consider privacy of victims and families
- Secure sensitive data appropriately
- Plan for your own potential incapacity or arrest

## Outputs

**Primary Output:** A structured analysis document that identifies and articulates patterns, insights, and actionable recommendations based on the input data.

**Format:**
```markdown
## Analysis: [Topic]

### Key Findings
- [Finding 1]
- [Finding 2]
- [Finding 3]

### Recommendations
1. [Action 1]
2. [Action 2]
3. [Action 3]
```

**Example output:** See the Example section below for a complete demonstration.

## Additional Notes

**Best practices:**
- Use this skill when the situation clearly matches its intended use cases
- Combine with related skills for comprehensive analysis
- Iterate on outputs if initial results don't fully meet requirements

**Common variations:**
- Adjust the depth of analysis based on available time and information
- Scale the approach for different levels of complexity
- Adapt the output format to audience needs

**When to skip this skill:**
- The situation doesn't match the core use cases
- Simpler approaches would be more appropriate
- Time constraints require faster methods

## Example

**Input**: Document police violence during protests that authorities are minimizing

**Output**:
"Create database: Each incident gets entry with date, time, location, victim name (with consent), injury type, video/photo evidence, witness contacts, official response. Verification: Require two independent sources or video evidence. Preservation: Database replicated on three continents, backed up to IPFS, printed archives with legal observers. Transformation: Interactive map showing incident density, video compilation, read-aloud of victim statements. Confrontation: Submit to UN human rights body, provide to civil rights lawyers, publish weekly reports with new verified incidents."

## Integration

Works with:
- **memorial-design**: Transform documentation into commemorative form
- **evidence-authentication**: Verify documentary evidence for credibility
- **internal-channel-audit**: Document attempts to use official channels before going public
