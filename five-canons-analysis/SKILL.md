# Five Canons Analysis

Apply the complete classical framework of rhetoric to prepare any persuasive communication - systematically addressing Invention, Arrangement, Style, Memory, and Delivery for maximum impact.

---

## When to Use

- User says "How do I make this more persuasive?" or "Help me structure this"
- Preparing a speech, pitch, presentation, or important message
- Request to "make this compelling" or "convince them"
- Any situation requiring comprehensive rhetorical preparation
- When communication stakes are high and preparation time is available

---

## The Five Canons Framework

### Canon 1: Inventio (Invention)
"What is to be said?"

Discover the available means of persuasion:

**The Three Appeals:**
- **Ethos** - What credibility do you bring? What can you demonstrate?
- **Logos** - What evidence, logic, and reasoning support your case?
- **Pathos** - What emotions are relevant? What does the audience fear, hope, or care about?

**The Topics (Topoi) for Finding Arguments:**
- Definition: What is this thing, essentially?
- Comparison: What is it like/unlike?
- Relationship: What causes/results from it?
- Circumstance: What is possible/impossible?
- Testimony: Who supports this? What precedents exist?
- Statistics: What data supports the case?
- Narrative: What stories illustrate the point?

**Questions to answer:**
1. What are the strongest logical arguments for your position?
2. What credentials or character evidence support your credibility?
3. What emotions will move this specific audience?
4. What objections will arise, and how will you address them?

---

### Canon 2: Dispositio (Arrangement)
"In what order?"

Organize for maximum persuasive effect:

**Classical Six-Part Structure:**

1. **Exordium** (Introduction)
   - Capture attention
   - Establish goodwill (ethos)
   - State the thesis or preview the journey

2. **Narratio** (Background/Context)
   - Provide necessary context
   - Tell the story that frames the issue
   - Build common ground

3. **Partitio** (Division/Outline)
   - Preview main points
   - Create mental scaffolding
   - Set expectations

4. **Confirmatio** (Proof)
   - Present strongest arguments
   - Deploy evidence
   - Build the logical case

5. **Refutatio** (Refutation)
   - Address counterarguments
   - Inoculate against objections
   - Strengthen by engaging opposition

6. **Peroratio** (Conclusion)
   - Summarize key points
   - Make emotional appeal (pathos climax)
   - Call to action

**Arrangement Strategies:**
- Strongest argument first (if audience skeptical)
- Strongest argument last (if audience neutral)
- Sandwich: Strong - Weak - Strongest
- Problem - Solution - Benefits
- Before - After - Bridge

---

### Canon 3: Elocutio (Style)
"In what words?"

Choose language for effect:

**The Three Levels of Style:**
- **Grand** - For moving emotions, inspiring action, solemn occasions
- **Middle** - For pleasing and establishing credibility
- **Plain** - For teaching and conveying information clearly

**Key Decisions:**
- Formal or conversational?
- Technical or accessible?
- Brief or elaborate?
- Literal or figurative?

**Rhetorical Figures to Consider:**
- Anaphora (repetition at beginning): "We shall fight..."
- Tricolon (rule of three): "Government of the people, by the people, for the people"
- Antithesis (contrast): "Ask not what your country can do for you..."
- Metaphor: Illuminates through comparison
- Rhetorical question: Engages audience thinking

**Questions to answer:**
1. What level of style fits this audience and occasion?
2. What key phrases should be memorable?
3. Where do you need clarity? Where do you need emotion?

---

### Canon 4: Memoria (Memory)
"How will you own it?"

Internalize for natural delivery:

**Techniques:**
- Master the structure (know the six-part flow)
- Create mental landmarks for each section
- Practice key phrases until they're automatic
- Know the content deeply enough to depart from script
- Use the "memory palace" for complex material

**Goals:**
- Deliver without reading
- Respond flexibly to audience reactions
- Maintain eye contact and presence
- Speak from knowledge, not memorization

---

### Canon 5: Pronuntiatio (Delivery)
"How will you present it?"

Execute with presence:

**Voice:**
- Vary pace (slow for emphasis, faster for energy)
- Vary volume (quiet draws in, loud emphasizes)
- Use strategic pauses (before key points, after questions)
- Modulate pitch (avoid monotone)

**Body:**
- Eye contact (connect with individuals)
- Gesture purposefully (open hands, counted points)
- Stance (grounded, facing audience)
- Movement (intentional, not nervous)

**Presence:**
- Project confidence even when uncertain
- Embrace silence rather than filling with filler
- Respond to audience energy
- Recover gracefully from errors

- Acknowledge when certain canons matter more than others for the context

---

## Outputs

**Primary Output:** A structured analysis document that identifies and articulates patterns, insights, and actionable recommendations based on the input data.

**Format:**
```markdown
## Analysis: [Topic]

### Key Findings
- [Finding 1]
- [Finding 2]
- [Finding 3]

### Recommendations
1. [Action 1]
2. [Action 2]
3. [Action 3]
```

**Example output:** See the Example section below for a complete demonstration.

## Example

**Input:** "I need to convince my engineering team to adopt test-driven development (TDD). They're skeptical and see it as extra work."

**Output:**



**Why this works:**

This example demonstrates the key principles of the skill in action. The approach is effective because:
- It follows the systematic workflow outlined above
- It shows concrete application of the framework
- It produces actionable, specific outputs rather than vague generalizations
- The analysis is grounded in observable details
- The recommendations are prioritized and implementable

**Alternative applications:**

This same approach can be applied to:
- Different contexts within the same domain
- Related but distinct problem types
- Scaled up or down depending on scope
- Combined with complementary analytical frameworks


## Five Canons Analysis: Adopting TDD

### 1. Inventio - Available Arguments

**Ethos (Credibility):**
- Your experience with TDD (if applicable)
- Reference respected engineers who advocate for TDD
- Acknowledge their expertise: "You know this codebase better than anyone"
- Show you understand their concerns: "I know this feels like more work upfront"

**Logos (Reasoning):**
- Bug reduction statistics (TDD catches bugs 40-80% earlier)
- Maintenance cost reduction (tests document behavior)
- Refactoring confidence (safety net for changes)
- Debugging time saved (test localizes failures)
- Example from similar team or project if available

**Pathos (Emotion):**
- Frustration with production bugs at 2 AM
- Pride in craftsmanship
- Security of knowing changes won't break things
- Fear of working on brittle legacy code

**Anticipated Objections:**
1. "It's slower" -> "Initial development is 15-20% slower; maintenance is 40% faster. We spend 60% of time maintaining, not building."
2. "We don't have time" -> "The team that doesn't have time to test will find time for debugging. Which would you prefer?"
3. "Tests are just more code to maintain" -> "Tests that catch bugs pay for themselves. Tests that don't, we should delete."

---

### 2. Dispositio - Recommended Structure

**I. Exordium**
"I want to talk about how we can ship faster with fewer bugs. I know that sounds like a sales pitch, so I'm going to show you the data and let you decide."

**II. Narratio**
[Recent story of a bug that was painful - late nights, customer complaints, or difficult debugging session. Connect to shared experience.]

**III. Partitio**
"I'll cover three things: what the research says, what it looks like in practice, and how we could try it without betting the whole roadmap."

**IV. Confirmatio**
- Present data on bug reduction
- Show one concrete example of TDD workflow
- Highlight the psychological benefit of green tests

**V. Refutatio**
"You're probably thinking 'this sounds nice but we don't have time.' Let me address that directly..."

**VI. Peroratio**
"I'm not asking you to believe me. I'm asking for two weeks, one small feature, TDD the whole way. If it's slower and worse, we drop it. If it's better, we talk about expanding. Deal?"

---

### 3. Elocutio - Style Recommendations

**Recommended Level:** Plain to Middle (engineers prefer directness; some elevation for key moments)

**Key Phrases to Craft:**
- Opening: "I want to propose an experiment that could make our lives easier."
- Central: "We currently pay for bugs in late-night debugging. TDD lets us pay upfront, when it's cheaper."
- Closing: "Two weeks. One feature. What do we have to lose?"

**Figures to Consider:**
- Antithesis: "The team that doesn't have time to test finds time to debug."
- Rhetorical question: "How many 2 AM pages would this prevent?"
- Tricolon: "Faster maintenance, fewer bugs, more confidence."

---

### 4. Memoria - Preparation Strategy

Know the three objections cold. Practice the story so it's natural. Have the data ready but don't lead with it - lead with the shared pain.

---

### 5. Pronuntiatio - Delivery Notes

- Stay conversational, not preachy
- Make eye contact with the skeptics especially
- When presenting data, slow down
- When proposing the experiment, open hands, direct but not demanding
- End with genuine curiosity: invite their concerns

## Integration

This skill is part of the **Cicero** expert persona. It provides the comprehensive framework that other Ciceronian skills (Speech Architecture, Ethos Construction, etc.) elaborate in specific areas. Use this for complete preparation; use specific skills for targeted improvement.
