# Competitive Intelligence Walk

Systematically learn from competitors by observing what they do *better* than you, not their weaknesses.

**Token Budget:** ~500 tokens
**Source Expert:** Sam Walton

---

## When to Use

- Planning competitive strategy
- Entering a new market with established players
- Feeling stuck or complacent
- "How do I learn from competitors?"
- "What are competitors doing right?"
- Before strategic planning sessions

---

## Sam Walton's Philosophy

"I was in their stores constantly because they were the laboratory, and they were better than we were. I spent a heck of a lot of my time wandering through their stores talking to their people and trying to figure out how they did things."

**The key insight:** Unlike most competitive analysis, Walton focused *only* on what competitors did better—never their weaknesses. Ego had no place in his world.

"Most everything I've done I've copied from somebody else."

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| competitor | Yes | The competitor(s) to study |
| your_operation | No | Your current approach for comparison |
| focus_areas | No | Specific aspects to observe |

## The Walk Protocol

### Step 1: Prepare with Humility

Before visiting, acknowledge:
- "They are the laboratory. They may be better than us."
- "My job is to learn, not to judge."
- "Every competitor survives because they do something right."

Leave your ego at the door. You're not looking for validation.

### Step 2: Observe Like Sam

**Physical environment:**
- How is the space laid out?
- What's the first thing you see?
- How do customers move?
- What's prominently displayed?

**People and process:**
- How are customers greeted?
- How do employees interact?
- What's the energy level?
- How fast are transactions?

**Details that compound:**
- What small touches do they do?
- What's cleaner, faster, or simpler?
- What would annoy me if I were a customer here?
- What clearly works that we don't do?

### Step 3: Document Strengths Only

For each observation, record:
- **What they do:** Specific practice or feature
- **Why it works:** The customer or operational benefit
- **Our gap:** How this differs from our approach
- **Adapt how:** How we could implement this

**Rule:** If you catch yourself noting a weakness, stop. Refocus on strengths.

### Step 4: Talk to Frontline People

If possible (and appropriate), ask employees:
- "What do customers seem to like most here?"
- "What's your busiest time? Why do you think?"
- "What's different about working here?"

Frontline workers know things executives don't.

### Step 5: The "What If" Test

For each strength identified:
- "What if we did this?"
- "What's stopping us?"
- "What would it cost to try?"

## Workflow

### Step 1: Gather and Review Inputs

Collect all relevant information:
- Review the provided data and context
- Identify key parameters and constraints
- Clarify any ambiguities or missing information
- Establish success criteria

### Step 2: Analyze the Situation

Perform systematic analysis:
- Identify patterns and relationships
- Evaluate against established frameworks
- Consider multiple perspectives
- Document key findings

### Step 3: Generate Recommendations

Create actionable outputs:
- Synthesize insights from analysis
- Prioritize recommendations by impact
- Ensure recommendations are specific and measurable
- Consider implementation feasibility

## Output Format

|--------------|--------------|---------|-----------------|
| [Observation 1] | [Benefit] | [Difference] | [Y/N + notes] |
| [Observation 2] | [Benefit] | [Difference] | [Y/N + notes] |

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Sam's Way |
|---------|-----------|
| Looking for weaknesses | Only note strengths |
| Assuming you can't learn from them | Everyone survives for a reason |
| Visiting once | Visit constantly—they change |
| Staying at executive level | Talk to frontline people |
| Noting but not adapting | Ideas without action are worthless |

---

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

| Anti-Pattern | Why It Fails | Instead Do |
|--------------|--------------|------------|
| **Looking for weaknesses** | Ego-driven analysis misses the learning opportunity | Document only strengths; this is about learning, not feeling superior |
| **One-time visit** | Competitors change; single observation is snapshot, not pattern | Visit constantly; make it a habit, not an event |
| **Executive-level only** | Strategic analysis misses operational details | Talk to frontline people who know what actually works |
| **Noting without adapting** | Ideas without implementation are worthless | Every observation should answer: "What would we try?" |
| **Assuming you can't learn from them** | Arrogance blinds you to improvement opportunities | Everyone survives for a reason; find that reason |

## Example

**Input:** "I run a regional coffee chain. Starbucks just opened three locations in our area. How do I learn from them instead of just resenting them?"

**Output:**

## Competitive Intelligence Walk: Starbucks (Downtown Location)

**Date:** Tuesday, 7:30 AM (peak commute)
**Location/Context:** New downtown Starbucks, one block from our flagship store

### Strengths Observed

| What They Do | Why It Works | Our Gap | Could We Adapt? |
|--------------|--------------|---------|-----------------|
| Mobile order pickup is separate area | No line confusion; mobile customers in/out in 30 seconds | We have one line for everything | Yes - designate pickup zone |
| Staff greets by name (mobile orders) | Personal connection despite volume; loyalty reinforced | We don't track customer names | Partial - could on regulars |
| Menu board shows 4 items max at eye level | Reduces decision paralysis; speeds ordering | Our board has 20+ items displayed | Yes - simplify display |
| Every drink announced when ready | Customer doesn't have to watch; can sit | We just call names | Yes - simple change |
| Bathroom requires code on receipt | Reduces non-customer loitering; bathroom cleaner | Anyone can use ours | Consider - might feel unwelcoming |

### Top 3 Ideas to Borrow

1. **Separate mobile pickup zone:** Even without an app, we could designate a "phone order pickup" area and promote phone-ahead ordering. Reduces line anxiety.

2. **Simplified display menu:** Our visual complexity is overwhelming. Test showing 4 signature drinks prominently; full menu available but not screaming.

3. **Drink announcement protocol:** Announce drink and name clearly when ready. Simple operational change, immediate improvement.

### What I'd Try First

**Mobile pickup zone.** We already have phone orders; we just make them wait in the same line. Dedicating a corner with a sign "Phone Orders: Pick Up Here" costs nothing and immediately improves experience for our fastest customers.

## Integration

This skill pairs with:
- **swim-upstream-analysis** - After learning what competitors do, find where to diverge
- **frontline-intelligence** - Apply the same "ask the people who know" approach internally
