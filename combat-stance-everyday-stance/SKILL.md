# Combat Stance Everyday Stance

Audit and align everyday behavior with peak performance requirements. Eliminate the gap between how you operate daily and how you need to perform when it matters.

---

## When to Use

- User's daily habits do not support their stated goals
- Gap between "training" and "real performance"
- Inconsistency between peak moments and everyday behavior
- Request to build sustainable readiness or discipline
- Preparing for high-stakes situation that requires consistent capability

---

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| peak_requirement | Yes | What the user needs to be capable of at critical moments |
| current_practice | No | How they currently operate day-to-day |
| gap_areas | No | Where inconsistency is already noticed |
| constraints | No | Real limits on time, energy, or resources |

---

## The Alignment Framework

### Principle

"In all forms of strategy, it is necessary to maintain the combat stance in everyday life and to make your everyday stance your combat stance."

The warrior who trains one way and fights another has trained for defeat. Your daily behavior is your true training. Everything else is fantasy.

---

### Step 1: Define Combat Requirements

What must you be capable of when it matters most?

- **Physical capability:** What does your body need to do?
- **Mental state:** What quality of attention, clarity, or creativity is required?
- **Emotional regulation:** What pressures must you handle without breaking?
- **Skill execution:** What specific abilities must be available on demand?

Be specific. "Be successful" is not a combat requirement. "Make clear decisions under pressure with incomplete information" is.

### Step 2: Audit Current Everyday Stance

How do you actually operate day-to-day?

- **Energy management:** How do you sleep, eat, move, recover?
- **Attention patterns:** What gets your focus? What fragments it?
- **Default responses:** How do you handle small pressures, minor conflicts, everyday decisions?
- **Skill practice:** What are you actually training through daily repetition?

**Musashi's insight:** "The Way is in training." What you repeat becomes what you are.

### Step 3: Identify the Gaps

Where does everyday stance fail to support combat stance?

| Combat Requirement | Everyday Practice | Gap |
|-------------------|-------------------|-----|
| [Need A] | [Current behavior] | [Misalignment] |
| ... | ... | ... |

Common patterns:
- Training hard but recovering poorly
- Wanting clarity but consuming chaos (news, social media, constant input)
- Needing decisiveness but practicing procrastination
- Requiring emotional stability but indulging emotional reactivity

### Step 4: Prescribe Alignment

For each gap, what everyday practice would train the combat requirement?

**The test:** If someone observed only your daily behavior, would they predict your capability at the critical moment?

**Musashi's insight:** "Do nothing which is of no use."

- **Remove:** What daily practice is actively training weakness?
- **Add:** What practice would build the required capability?
- **Modify:** What current behavior could be adjusted to serve better?

### Step 5: Create Practice Protocols

Specific, daily, sustainable practices that build toward combat capability.

Requirements for good protocols:
- Simple enough to maintain when tired or stressed
- Directly connected to combat requirement
- Observable (you know if you did it)
- Progressive (can be developed over time)

## Workflow

### Step 1: Gather and Review Inputs

Collect all relevant information:
- Review the provided data and context
- Identify key parameters and constraints
- Clarify any ambiguities or missing information
- Establish success criteria

### Step 2: Analyze the Situation

Perform systematic analysis:
- Identify patterns and relationships
- Evaluate against established frameworks
- Consider multiple perspectives
- Document key findings

### Step 3: Generate Recommendations

Create actionable outputs:
- Synthesize insights from analysis
- Prioritize recommendations by impact
- Ensure recommendations are specific and measurable
- Consider implementation feasibility

## Output Format

```markdown
## Combat Stance Everyday Stance Assessment

### Combat Requirements
[What you must be capable of at peak moments, specific]

### Current Everyday Stance
[How you actually operate daily]

### Gap Analysis
| Requirement | Current Practice | Gap | Impact |
|-------------|------------------|-----|--------|
| [Need] | [Behavior] | [Misalignment] | [Cost] |

### Alignment Prescription

**Remove:** [practices training weakness]
- [specific behavior to eliminate]

**Add:** [practices building capability]
- [specific behavior to introduce]

**Modify:** [adjustments to current behavior]
- [specific change to make]

### Daily Protocols
**Morning:**
[specific practice]

**Throughout day:**
[specific practice]

**Evening:**
[specific practice]

### The Test

## Constraints

- Do not prescribe unsustainable practices—they will fail
- Do not separate "training time" from "life time"—everything is training
- Do not assume more activity is better—removal often matters more
- Acknowledge real constraints on time and energy

---

## Outputs

**Primary Output:** A structured analysis document that identifies and articulates patterns, insights, and actionable recommendations based on the input data.

**Format:**
```markdown
## Analysis: [Topic]

### Key Findings
- [Finding 1]
- [Finding 2]
- [Finding 3]

### Recommendations
1. [Action 1]
2. [Action 2]
3. [Action 3]
```

**Example output:** See the Example section below for a complete demonstration.

## Example

**Input:** "I need to be sharp in high-stakes presentations, but I'm always running on fumes. By the time I present, I'm exhausted and caffeinated and barely holding it together."

**Output:**



**Why this works:**

This example demonstrates the key principles of the skill in action. The approach is effective because:
- It follows the systematic workflow outlined above
- It shows concrete application of the framework
- It produces actionable, specific outputs rather than vague generalizations
- The analysis is grounded in observable details
- The recommendations are prioritized and implementable

**Alternative applications:**

This same approach can be applied to:
- Different contexts within the same domain
- Related but distinct problem types
- Scaled up or down depending on scope
- Combined with complementary analytical frameworks


## Combat Stance Everyday Stance Assessment

### Combat Requirements
Mental clarity under pressure. Physical energy that does not require chemical support. Emotional calm that allows natural presence. Ability to think on feet, respond to challenges, and project confidence.

### Current Everyday Stance
Chronic sleep deficit. Caffeine dependence. High-stimulation information diet. No recovery practices. Presentation preparation done in anxious bursts close to deadline. Victory defined as "surviving."

### Gap Analysis
| Requirement | Current Practice | Gap | Impact |
|-------------|------------------|-----|--------|
| Mental clarity | Fragmented attention, constant input | Training scattered thinking | Cannot access clarity under pressure |
| Sustained energy | Sleep deficit, caffeine cycles | Training depletion | Crashing when it matters |
| Emotional calm | No regulation practice | Training reactivity | Anxiety leaks through facade |
| Quick thinking | No practice responding | Training avoidance | Dreading Q&A sections |

### Alignment Prescription

**Remove:**
- Evening screen time in the hour before sleep
- Information consumption that does not serve you (news, social feeds, chaos input)
- Caffeine after noon
- Last-minute preparation—it trains panic, not performance

**Add:**
- 7+ hours sleep as non-negotiable (this IS presentation prep)
- 10 minutes daily of extemporaneous speaking practice (voice memos, shower, wherever)
- One block of deep focus work daily—train the attention you need
- Physical movement that builds, not depletes (walking, not exhausting workouts)

**Modify:**
- Preparation timeline: major content done 3+ days before, then refinement only
- Morning caffeine only, treat as tool not fuel
- Pre-presentation day: no demanding work, early sleep, light food

### Daily Protocols

**Morning:**
5 minutes of silence before input. This trains the calm you need at the podium.

**Throughout day:**
One 90-minute block of deep work. No interruptions. Train the sustained focus.
Speak thoughts aloud when possible—train verbal fluency.

**Evening:**
Reflection on one moment of clarity from the day. Sleep at consistent time.
No screens one hour before bed.

### The Test
Ask: "If I operated exactly this way for the next month, would I arrive at my next presentation rested, clear, and capable?" If no, the stance is still wrong.
