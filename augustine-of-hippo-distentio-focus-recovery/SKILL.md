# Distentio Focus Recovery

Diagnose and remedy attention fragmentation using Augustine's threefold present (memory, attention, expectation) to restore focused productivity.

---

## When to Use

- Feeling scattered across too many priorities
- Context-switching is destroying productivity
- Unable to focus despite desire to work
- Overwhelmed by competing demands
- "Too many things on my plate"
- Planning paralysis or execution paralysis
- User says "I can't focus" or "Help me find focus"
- Time feels like it's slipping away without accomplishment

---

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| current_state | Yes | Description of attention, tasks, and symptoms of fragmentation |
| competing_demands | No | List of things pulling at attention |
| symptoms | No | How the fragmentation manifests (anxiety, exhaustion, paralysis) |

## Augustine's Theory of Time and Attention

From *Confessions* Book XI, Augustine discovered that time exists in the soul through three faculties:

| Faculty | Temporal Mode | Function |
|---------|--------------|----------|
| **Memory** | Present of things past | Retains what was; anchors identity and learning |
| **Attention** | Present of things present | Direct engagement with the now; where work happens |
| **Expectation** | Present of things future | Anticipates what will be; enables planning |

**The Problem: Distentio Animi (Distension of the Soul)**

The soul is "stretched" (*distentio*) when pulled between memory, attention, and expectation simultaneously:
- Ruminating on the past (memory dominating)
- Anxious about the future (expectation dominating)
- Unable to engage the present (attention scattered)

"We suffer when pulled in all directions; peace comes through concentration (*intentio*) on what is eternal."

**The Solution: Intentio (Gathering Focus)**

*Intentio* is the remedy - gathering the scattered self into focused attention. The movement from *distentio* to *intentio* is the recovery of productive capacity.

---

## The Recovery Process

### Step 1: Diagnose the Distention

Where is the soul being stretched? Map the fragmentation:

**Memory Overload:**
- Dwelling on past failures or successes
- Unprocessed experiences demanding attention
- "Lessons learned" that haven't been integrated
- Resentments or regrets consuming mental energy

**Expectation Overload:**
- Anxiety about future deadlines or possibilities
- Planning that never becomes doing
- Fear of outcomes not yet arrived
- Constant projection into "what if"

**Attention Fragmentation:**
- Too many "present" demands competing
- Context-switching between unrelated tasks
- Notifications and interruptions
- The present moment sliced into unusable fragments

**Key Question:** "How is your soul being stretched between past, present, and future right now?"

### Step 2: Identify False Urgencies

Not everything demanding attention deserves it. Distinguish:

| Type | Description | Test |
|------|-------------|------|
| **True Urgency** | Must be addressed now; delay causes real harm | "What happens if I wait 24 hours?" |
| **False Urgency** | Feels urgent but can wait | Urgency comes from anxiety, not reality |
| **Important but Not Urgent** | Matters but has no immediate deadline | Often crowded out by false urgencies |
| **Neither Urgent Nor Important** | Noise masquerading as signal | Often the most seductive distractions |

**Key Question:** "What is demanding attention that would not harm anything if delayed?"

### Step 3: Process the Past (Memory Work)

Unprocessed memory fragments consume attention. Clear the backlog:

- What past events are demanding processing?
- What decisions remain unresolved?
- What "open loops" from the past need closing?
- What can be explicitly released?

**Practice:** Write down what memory is holding. Decide: process now, schedule for later, or consciously release.

### Step 4: Contain the Future (Expectation Work)

Expectation must serve attention, not dominate it:

- What fears about the future are consuming present attention?
- What planning is sufficient? (More planning often increases anxiety)
- What outcomes are not actually in your control?
- What can be trusted to "future you"?

**Practice:** Schedule specific times for planning and worry. Outside those times, expectation is contained.

### Step 5: Gather into Intentio (Present Focus)

With memory processed and expectation contained, gather into focused attention:

1. **Choose one thing.** Not three priorities - one.
2. **Clear the space.** Remove what fragments attention
3. **Enter the present.** The past is not now; the future is not yet; only attention is real
4. **Sustain the focus.** Intentio requires protection and duration

**Key Insight:** "Plans (expectation) and documentation (memory) are not the work; attention is."

## Workflow

### Step 1: Gather and Review Inputs

Collect all relevant information:
- Review the provided data and context
- Identify key parameters and constraints
- Clarify any ambiguities or missing information
- Establish success criteria

### Step 2: Analyze the Situation

Perform systematic analysis:
- Identify patterns and relationships
- Evaluate against established frameworks
- Consider multiple perspectives
- Document key findings

### Step 3: Generate Recommendations

Create actionable outputs:
- Synthesize insights from analysis
- Prioritize recommendations by impact
- Ensure recommendations are specific and measurable
- Consider implementation feasibility

## Output Format

```markdown
## Distentio Focus Recovery

### Current State of Distention

**Memory Pulling:**
- [What from the past is consuming attention]

**Expectation Pulling:**
- [What future concerns are consuming attention]

**Attention Fragmented:**
- [What present demands are competing]

### False Urgencies Identified
| Demand | Type | Can Wait? |
|--------|------|-----------|
| [Demand] | [False/True Urgency] | [Yes/No] |

### Memory Work Required
| Unprocessed Item | Resolution | When |
|-----------------|------------|------|
| [Past item] | Process/Schedule/Release | [Now/Later/Now-released] |

### Expectation Containment
| Future Concern | Action | Containment |
|---------------|--------|-------------|
| [Fear/plan] | [What if anything to do] | [How to limit its claim on attention] |

### Intentio Focus
**The One Thing:** [Single focus for attention]

**Cleared:** [What has been removed/contained]

**Duration:** [How long to sustain focus before review]

### Recovery Practice
[Specific practices for maintaining intentio going forward]
```

---

## Constraints

- **Do not add more tasks.** The goal is focus, not productivity theater
- **One thing, not three.** Multiple priorities is continued distentio
- **Respect the limits of attention.** Intentio cannot be sustained indefinitely; plan for renewal
- **Process, don't suppress.** Memory and expectation suppressed will return; they must be addressed
- **The present has no extension.** You cannot "store up" focused time; you can only be focused now

**Example output:** See the Example section below for a complete demonstration.

## Example

**Input:** "I have five projects at work, each with stakeholders asking for updates. My inbox has 200 unread emails. I'm supposed to be writing a proposal due Friday but I can't get started. I keep thinking about a conversation with my manager last week where she seemed disappointed. I'm exhausted but feel like I can't rest because there's too much to do."

**Output:**

## Distentio Focus Recovery

### Current State of Distention

**Memory Pulling:**
- Conversation with manager "where she seemed disappointed" - unprocessed, generating anxiety
- 200 unread emails represent accumulated unprocessed inputs

**Expectation Pulling:**
- Friday proposal deadline creating anticipatory anxiety
- Fear of stakeholder disappointment (five projects asking for updates)
- Fear that rest will make things worse (can't rest because too much to do)

**Attention Fragmented:**
- Five projects competing for "present" attention
- Inbox as constant source of new demands
- Proposal cannot be started because attention is already claimed

### False Urgencies Identified

| Demand | Type | Can Wait? |
|--------|------|-----------|
| 5 stakeholder update requests | False Urgency (feels urgent, but updates can be brief/batched) | Yes - 24 hours |
| 200 unread emails | False Urgency (most are not actually urgent) | Yes - can triage |
| Friday proposal | True Urgency (deadline with real consequence) | No - this is the priority |
| Processing manager conversation | Important but Not Urgent | Yes - but must be scheduled |

### Memory Work Required

| Unprocessed Item | Resolution | When |
|-----------------|------------|------|
| Manager conversation | Schedule 15min to clarify with manager or process alone | Tomorrow morning |
| 200 emails | Triage session: delete/delegate/defer/do (15min) | Today, after proposal work |
| Accumulated "should haves" | Release: they are past; only present action exists | Now - released |

### Expectation Containment

| Future Concern | Action | Containment |
|---------------|--------|-------------|
| Friday deadline | Proposal is today's focus | Other projects wait until proposal done |
| Stakeholder disappointment | Send brief "update coming Friday" to all 5 | 5-minute email, then contained |
| "Can't rest" fear | Rest is scheduled (tonight), not optional | Trust future-self to continue tomorrow |

### Intentio Focus

**The One Thing:** The Friday proposal

**Cleared:**
- Stakeholders: Brief holding message sent
- Emails: Triage scheduled for end of day
- Manager conversation: Scheduled for tomorrow
- Other projects: Explicitly on hold until Friday

**Duration:** 2-hour focused block, then reassess. Repeat tomorrow.

### Recovery Practice

1. **Morning containment ritual:** 5 minutes to acknowledge memory and expectation, then consciously set aside
2. **Single-task blocks:** 90-120 minutes of intentio, then break
3. **Scheduled worry time:** 10 minutes at day's end to let expectation speak, then contain
4. **Weekly processing:** Clear memory backlog before it accumulates (emails, conversations, decisions)
5. **Rest as non-negotiable:** Exhaustion increases distentio; rest enables intentio

**Augustine's reminder:** "The past is no longer; the future is not yet; the present has no extension." The proposal exists only in present attention. Everything else is either memory or expectation claiming what does not belong to them.

## Integration

This skill is part of the **Augustine of Hippo** expert persona. It applies Augustine's philosophy of time from *Confessions* Book XI to practical focus and attention management.

For related analysis:
- Use **ordo-amoris-audit** if priority confusion is the root cause
- Use **grace-before-effort** if willpower alone cannot sustain focus
- Use **confessional-analysis** if past failures need processing before moving forward
