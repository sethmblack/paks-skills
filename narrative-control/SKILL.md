# Narrative Control

Shape how events are understood before others can frame them. Write your own history before your enemies write it for you.

**Source Expert:** Julius Caesar
**Category:** Communication / Strategy

---

## When to Use

- Your actions are being mischaracterized
- Opponents are defining the story about you
- You need to explain complex decisions to multiple audiences
- Public perception matters to your success
- A crisis requires careful communication
- You're launching something that could be misunderstood

**Trigger Phrases:**
- "How do I shape how people see this?"
- "Others are framing this negatively"
- "I need to tell my story"
- "How do I control the narrative?"
- "People are misunderstanding my actions"
- "The press is going to spin this"

---

## The Historical Context

Caesar's *Commentarii de Bello Gallico* was not merely a war diary - it was a masterwork of narrative control. Published in annual installments and sent to Rome during his campaigns, the Commentaries reached the Roman public before his enemies could craft their version.

**Key techniques:**
- Third-person narration created apparent objectivity
- Matter-of-fact tone made extraordinary claims seem routine
- Aggressive wars of conquest were framed as defensive necessity
- Setbacks were minimized; victories magnified
- By the time critics spoke, the public already knew Caesar's version

Historian David Henige called Caesar "one of history's earliest and most durably successful spin doctors."

**The insight:** The first story told often becomes the accepted truth. Speed in narrative matters as much as speed in battle.

---

## Workflow
### Step 1: 1. Assess the Narrative Battlefield

**Current state:**
- What story is currently being told?
- Who is telling it?
- Who is hearing it?
- What emotional response does it create?

**Threat assessment:**
- What narrative do opponents want to establish?
- What facts do they emphasize?
- What facts do they omit?
- What emotional response do they seek?

### Step 2: 2. Define Your Narrative

**Core elements:**
- **The Why:** The legitimate purpose behind your actions
- **The Context:** What circumstances made this necessary or appropriate
- **The Result:** What good comes from this
- **The Alternative:** What worse outcome was avoided

**The Frame:**
What single sentence captures how this should be understood?
- "This was necessary because..."
- "This represents..."
- "This was the only way to..."

### Step 3: 3. Identify Your Audiences

Different audiences need different emphases:

| Audience | Their Concern | Your Emphasis |
|----------|--------------|---------------|
| [Audience 1] | [What they care about] | [Aspect to highlight] |
| [Audience 2] | [What they care about] | [Aspect to highlight] |

### Step 4: 4. Control the Timing

**Speed matters:**
- Your version should reach audiences before opponents' version
- First impressions anchor subsequent perceptions
- If you're explaining, you're already behind

**Preemption when possible:**
- Frame the narrative before the event if you can
- Prepare audiences for what will happen and why

### Step 5: 5. Choose Your Medium

**Direct communication:**
- Unmediated access to your audience
- Full control of message
- But may lack credibility of third-party validation

**Third-party validators:**
- More credibility
- Less control
- Requires trusted intermediaries

**Public record:**
- Creates permanent version
- Can be referenced and shared
- Caesar's Commentaries were public documents

### Step 6: 6. Apply Caesar's Techniques

**Third-person authority:**
Present actions as objective facts rather than personal claims when appropriate.

**Understatement:**
Describe significant achievements in matter-of-fact terms. Overstating invites skepticism; understating invites admiration.

**Necessity framing:**
Present choices as inevitable responses to circumstances rather than aggressive actions.

**Context provision:**
Give enough background that your action appears as the only reasonable response.

**Minimal defense:**
State your version confidently. Excessive explanation suggests doubt.

**Example output:** See the Example section below for a complete demonstration.

## Constraints

- Do not use this analysis as the sole basis for critical decisions
- Do not apply this framework to situations outside its intended scope
- Acknowledge that analysis is based on available data, which may be incomplete
- Honor the complexity of real-world situations that resist simple categorization
- Present findings with appropriate confidence levels
- Recognize the limits of the methodology

## Additional Notes

**Best practices:**
- Use this skill when the situation clearly matches its intended use cases
- Combine with related skills for comprehensive analysis
- Iterate on outputs if initial results don't fully meet requirements

**Common variations:**
- Adjust the depth of analysis based on available time and information
- Scale the approach for different levels of complexity
- Adapt the output format to audience needs

**When to skip this skill:**
- The situation doesn't match the core use cases
- Simpler approaches would be more appropriate
- Time constraints require faster methods

## Example

**Input:**
- Situation: Company is laying off 15% of workforce
- Audiences: Employees, customers, investors, press
- Desired perception: Difficult but responsible decision for long-term health

**Output:**

## Narrative Control Analysis

### Situation
Technology company reducing workforce by 15% (approximately 200 employees)

### Current Narrative Landscape

**Opponent Narrative (competitors, critics):**
- Key claims: Company is failing; leadership made poor decisions
- Emotional appeal: Schadenfreude; "the mighty have fallen"
- Omissions: Industry-wide challenges; company's position relative to peers

**Neutral Current Perception:**
Layoffs = company in trouble = avoid as customer/investor

### Target Narrative

**Core Frame:**
Responsible leaders making difficult decisions early to ensure long-term success for all stakeholders.

**Key Messages:**
1. We are acting decisively while we have options, not waiting until forced
2. This positions us for sustainable growth rather than unsustainable headcount
3. We are treating affected employees with respect and generous support

**The Story:**
The technology sector is experiencing its first significant correction in a decade. Many companies are waiting, hoping conditions improve. We choose not to hope - we choose to act.

After careful analysis, we determined that sustainable growth requires a leaner, more focused organization. Making this decision now, while we remain financially strong, allows us to provide affected employees with meaningful support: extended severance, continued benefits, and active placement assistance.

This is difficult. These are our colleagues. But leadership requires making hard choices before they become desperate ones. Companies that act decisively from strength emerge stronger. Those that delay until forced often cannot recover.

### Audience Strategy

| Audience | Their Concern | Key Message | Medium |
|----------|--------------|-------------|--------|
| Remaining employees | Job security, company future | We're acting from strength; your jobs are more secure because of this | All-hands meeting, CEO direct |
| Affected employees | Fairness, support | Generous severance, placement support, gratitude for contributions | Personal meetings, written package |
| Customers | Continuity, reliability | No impact to service; stronger company serves you better | Account manager outreach, executive communication |
| Investors | Financial health, leadership | Proactive cost management; positioned for profitability | Investor call, 8-K filing |
| Press | Story angle | Access to CEO for "responsible leadership in downturn" narrative | Exclusive interview with business press |

### Timing Strategy
- **Immediate (Day 1):** All-hands before external announcement; affected employees notified personally; press release and investor call same morning
- **Short-term (Week 1):** CEO interviews emphasizing proactive decision-making; customer reassurance campaign
- **Ongoing:** Quarterly updates on return to growth; stories of affected employees successfully placed

### Anticipated Counter-Narratives
| Attack | Response |
|--------|----------|
| "Company is failing" | Financial strength data; acting early by choice |
| "Leadership failed" | Industry-wide correction; our timing is strategic |
| "Employees treated poorly" | Generous severance package details; placement support |
| "More cuts coming" | Clear statement that this is complete restructuring |

### Implementation
1. **Tonight:** Final executive alignment on messaging and numbers
2. **Tomorrow 8 AM:** All-hands announcement (no leaks possible)
3. **Tomorrow 9 AM:** Press release, investor call
4. **Tomorrow 11 AM:** Exclusive CEO interview with business press
5. **This week:** Customer and partner outreach complete

## Anti-Patterns

**DON'T:**
- Wait for others to define you (speed matters)
- Over-explain or sound defensive (confidence, not desperation)
- Lie or materially mislead (narrative control is emphasis, not fabrication)
- Ignore what opponents are saying (know their narrative to counter it)
- Use the same message for all audiences (tailor to concerns)
- Let the narrative drift after initial framing (reinforce consistently)

**The Test:** If your narrative requires lies to hold together, you have a truth problem, not a narrative problem. Address the underlying reality.

## Integration

This skill pairs with:
- **Rubicon Decision Framework:** Once you've crossed, immediately frame why
- **Strategic Clemency:** How you treat defeated opponents becomes part of your narrative
- **Lightning Campaign:** Speed in narrative matters as much as speed in action
