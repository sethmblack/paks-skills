# Six Stations Discipline

A complete framework for spiritual self-discipline derived from Al-Ghazali's *Ihya 'Ulum al-Din* Book 38 (Vigilance and Self-Examination). This system treats spiritual development as a cycle of commitment, watchfulness, accounting, consequence, effort, and correction.

## When to Use

- User explicitly requests this type of analysis or approach
- The situation matches the core use case for this skill
- You need to apply this specific framework or methodology
- The problem requires this particular perspective or lens
- Other approaches have failed and this offers a fresh angle




## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| input_data | Yes | The primary data or content to analyze |
| context | No | Additional background or constraints (default: none) |
| output_format | No | Preferred format for results (default: structured markdown) |

## Workflow
Al-Ghazali teaches that steadfast commitment (murabata) consists of six interconnected stations. Each breath is irreplaceable capital; the intellect must continuously guard the soul from squandering it.

### Step 1: Station 1: Musharata (Agreeing Conditions)

**When:** Each morning, before the day begins

**What:** Establish clear terms with your soul about what you will and will not do today.

**How:**
- Identify the specific obligations you must fulfill today
- Name the specific prohibitions you must avoid
- Condition the seven bodily members:
  - **Eyes:** What will I look at? What will I avert from?
  - **Ears:** What will I listen to? What will I refuse?
  - **Tongue:** What will I say? What will I restrain?
  - **Stomach:** What will I consume? What limits?
  - **Hands:** What will I do? What will I refrain from?
  - **Feet:** Where will I go? Where will I avoid?
  - **Sexual organs:** What boundaries will I maintain?

**The Merchant Metaphor:** Just as a trader sets conditions with a partner before conducting business, you must negotiate with your soul before the day's transactions begin.

---

### Step 2: Station 2: Muraqaba (Vigilance)

**When:** Throughout the day, during every action

**What:** Continuous watchfulness over the soul as you act.

**How:**
- Monitor whether actions spring from devotion to God or personal desire
- Watch like a cat waiting for a mouse - acute focus on every impulse
- Ask before each action: "Does this comply with my morning conditions?"
- Note when the soul tries to rationalize breaking its agreement

**The Standard:** "Worship God as if you see Him; if you do not see Him, know that He sees you."

**Warning Signs:**
- Doing something "just this once"
- Telling yourself "it's not that bad"
- Forgetting the morning conditions entirely
- Acting automatically without awareness

---

### Step 3: Station 3: Muhasaba (Self-Examination)

**When:** Each evening, after the day's activities

**What:** Accounting of the day's spiritual gains and losses.

**How:**
- Review each of the seven bodily members:
  - Did the eyes see what was forbidden?
  - Did the tongue speak what was harmful?
  - Did the feet go where they should not?
- Calculate the spiritual profit and loss:
  - What obligations were fulfilled?
  - What supererogatory good was done?
  - What opportunities were wasted?
  - What transgressions occurred?
- Be specific, not vague. Name particular actions.

**The Accountant Metaphor:** Like a merchant reconciling the day's accounts, weigh your spiritual transactions with precision. A vague "I was okay today" is insufficient.

---

### Step 4: Station 4: Mu'aqaba (Punishment)

**When:** After muhasaba reveals failure

**What:** Consequences for breaking the agreed conditions.

**How:**
- Denial of permitted comforts (not necessities)
- Increased difficulty proportionate to the failure
- The soul learns that transgression has cost

**Examples:**
- If you spoke harmfully, impose silence for a period
- If you overate, fast the next day
- If you wasted time, add extra worship
- If you looked where forbidden, lower your gaze entirely for a time

**Purpose:** Not self-harm but training. The soul that faces no consequences learns nothing.

---

### Step 5: Station 5: Mujahada (Renewed Striving)

**When:** After punishment, when the soul is chastened

**What:** Intensified effort to compel the resistant soul toward virtue.

**How:**
- Reimpose discipline with renewed commitment
- Add practices that strengthen weak areas
- Increase vigilance where failure occurred
- The soul that failed in restraining the tongue needs additional tongue-discipline

**The Key:** Failure is not the end. The cycle continues. Each failure, properly processed, becomes fuel for renewed striving.

---

### Step 6: Station 6: Mu'ataba (Self-Reproach)

**When:** Continuously, as a background disposition

**What:** Constant censure and admonishment of the soul.

**How:**
- Never trust the soul's claims of virtue
- Question its motives even in good actions
- Remind it of its tendency toward transgression
- Gradually transform it from the "blaming self" (nafs al-lawwama) toward the "tranquil self" (nafs al-mutma'inna)

**The Paradox:** The soul that reproaches itself is healthier than the soul that is satisfied with itself. Self-satisfaction is the most dangerous disease.

---

## The Daily Cycle

```
MORNING: Musharata (Set conditions)
    ↓
DAY: Muraqaba (Watch vigilantly)
    ↓
EVENING: Muhasaba (Account for the day)
    ↓
    → If failure: Mu'aqaba (Apply consequence)
        ↓
        Mujahada (Renew striving)
    ↓
ALWAYS: Mu'ataba (Reproach the soul)
    ↓
NEXT MORNING: Begin again with Musharata
```

## How to Use This Skill

**When someone presents with:**
- Inability to maintain spiritual disciplines
- Repeated failure in the same areas
- Vague sense of spiritual slippage without diagnosis
- Desire for a structured approach to self-improvement
- Need for accountability framework

**Guide them through:**
1. Explain the six stations and their purpose
2. Help them establish specific morning conditions (musharata)
3. Teach the vigilance mindset (muraqaba)
4. Structure their evening accounting (muhasaba)
5. Help them design appropriate consequences (mu'aqaba)
6. Set expectations for ongoing self-reproach (mu'ataba)

## Sample Application

**Seeker says:** "I keep trying to control my anger but I fail every time. I make promises to myself and break them within hours."

**Six Stations Response:**

Your failure has a structure, and so does its remedy. You are attempting muraqaba (vigilance) and muhasaba (accounting) without musharata (conditions). You are trying to watch a road without knowing where it leads.

Tomorrow morning, before you leave your room, establish conditions with your soul:

**Musharata:** "Today, when I feel anger rising, I will not speak for ten breaths. If someone provokes me, I will say 'I need a moment' and step away. I will not raise my voice. I will not use harsh words. These are my conditions."

Be specific. Not "I will control my anger" but "I will not speak for ten breaths when anger rises."

**Muraqaba:** Throughout the day, watch for the early signs of anger. The tightness in the chest. The quickening of breath. These are the cat's prey appearing. Catch the mouse before it becomes a lion.

**Muhasaba:** Tonight, review specifically: When did anger arise? Did I take the ten breaths? Did I step away? Name the specific incidents.

**Mu'aqaba:** If you failed, there must be consequence. Perhaps you fast the next day. Perhaps you apologize to someone you wronged previously. The soul must learn that breaking conditions has cost.

**Mujahada:** After the consequence, renew your commitment. Add a practice: before any difficult conversation, invoke "There is no power nor strength except through God."

**Mu'ataba:** And always, distrust the soul when it says "I've changed." The soul that announces victory has already begun its defeat. Keep reproaching it. Keep watching.

This is not one battle but a campaign. The six stations are your strategy. Apply them, and you will not merely suppress anger - you will transform the soul that generates it.

- Adapt the output format to audience needs

**When to skip this skill:**
- The situation doesn't match the core use cases
