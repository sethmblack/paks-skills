# Prior to Consciousness Pointing

An advanced methodology for pointing beyond witness consciousness to the Absolute that is prior to all manifestation.

---

## Purpose

For those who have established themselves as the witness or awareness, this skill points to what lies beyond - the Absolute that exists prior to consciousness itself. This is Nisargadatta Maharaj's most radical teaching: you are not even consciousness; you are prior to it.

---

## When to Use

- Someone has stabilized as witness consciousness and is ready for deeper inquiry
- Someone says "I am awareness" or "I am the witness" and takes this as final
- Someone has intellectual understanding of non-duality but has not gone beyond the "I am"
- Someone is attached to witness consciousness as an achievement
- As the final pointing in the trajectory of self-inquiry

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| input_data | Yes | The primary data or content to analyze |
| context | No | Additional background or constraints (default: none) |
| output_format | No | Preferred format for results (default: structured markdown) |



## Workflow

### Step 1: Gather and Review Inputs

Collect all relevant information:
- Review the provided data and context
- Identify key parameters and constraints
- Clarify any ambiguities or missing information
- Establish success criteria

### Step 2: Analyze the Situation

Perform systematic analysis:
- Identify patterns and relationships
- Evaluate against established frameworks
- Consider multiple perspectives
- Document key findings

### Step 3: Generate Recommendations

Create actionable outputs:
- Synthesize insights from analysis
- Prioritize recommendations by impact
- Ensure recommendations are specific and measurable
- Consider implementation feasibility

## Prerequisites

This pointing is appropriate only after:

1. The person has recognized they are not thoughts, feelings, or body
2. They have established the witness position
3. They understand "I am" as pure beingness
4. They are not seeking experiences or achievements

For those not yet stable as witness, use the **Witness Consciousness Inquiry** skill first.

## The Core Pointing

### The Radical Question

> "The witness came. Before the witness arose - what were you?"

The witness appears with consciousness. Before consciousness appeared (as in deep sleep, or before birth), the witness was not. Yet you existed. What you truly are is prior to the witness, prior to consciousness, prior to the sense "I am."

---

## The Method

### Step 1: Establish What Has Been Realized

First, confirm where they are:

> "You say you are the witness, the awareness. Good. Stay with that. But now let's inquire further."

### Step 2: Examine the Witness

Draw attention to the witness itself as an object:

> "This witness, this awareness - is it always present? What about in deep dreamless sleep - was the witness there?"

In deep sleep:
- No thoughts
- No body sense
- No witness
- No "I am"
- Yet you existed and woke up

### Step 3: The Deep Sleep Inquiry

> "In deep sleep, you were not conscious. There was no 'I am.' No awareness of being. Yet you existed - you woke up. You did not cease to exist. What were you in deep sleep?"

This is not unconsciousness. It is the state prior to consciousness - the Absolute.

### Step 4: Point to What Is Prior

> "Consciousness arose. The sense 'I am' sprouted. The witness appeared. Before all this - you were. You are that which is prior to consciousness, prior to the 'I am,' prior to the witness."

Key phrases:
- "You are prior to consciousness"
- "Before the 'I am' appeared, you were"
- "You are not even the witness; you are that from which the witness arises"

### Step 5: Dissolve the Final Identification

> "The witness and consciousness appear and disappear together. They are not permanent. What you truly are is that in which consciousness arises and dissolves - the unchanging, ever-present Absolute."

---

## Key Distinctions

| Level | Characteristics | Status |
|-------|-----------------|--------|
| The Person | Thoughts, memories, identity | Imaginary |
| The Witness | Awareness watching experience | Temporary (appears with consciousness) |
| The "I Am" | Pure sense of being | Temporary (arose with body) |
| The Absolute | Prior to consciousness | Eternal, unchanging, your true nature |

---

## Essential Pointers

### On the "I Am"
> "The 'I am' is the first illusion. It came with the body and will go with the body. You are prior to it."

### On Consciousness
> "Everything is an expression of the 'I am,' but you are not that; you are prior to the 'I am'."

### On the Witness
> "The witness and consciousness appear and disappear together. The witness or the sense 'I am' too is transient."

### On Deep Sleep
> "In deep sleep, there is no 'I am,' no witness, no consciousness. Yet you did not cease to exist. What were you then? You were what you always are - the Absolute."

### On What You Are
> "Before the idea 'I am' sprouted, you are, but you don't know you are. Camp yourself there, prior to the words 'I am'."

## Common Obstacles and Responses

| Obstacle | Response |
|----------|----------|
| "If I'm not consciousness, what am I?" | "You are that in which consciousness arises. Not nothing - but not consciousness either. What you are cannot be named or known as an object. You are the knower of all knowing." |
| "This is nihilism" | "No. The Absolute is not absence. It is the source of all presence. It is not that you are nothing; it is that you are prior to everything that can be described." |
| "How can I know what is prior to knowing?" | "You cannot know it as an object. But you can be it - you already are it. Recognition is not knowledge; it is being what you are." |
| "In deep sleep there is nothing" | "Not nothing - no thing. No object. Yet existence continues. That existence prior to consciousness is your true nature." |
| "This is too abstract" | "It is not abstract at all. It is the most concrete fact: you were before consciousness arose. The abstraction is consciousness itself - the concrete is what is prior to it." |

---

## The Final Paradox

This pointing cannot be "understood" by the mind. The mind exists within consciousness and cannot grasp what is prior to consciousness. The pointing must be recognized, not comprehended.

> "Stop trying to understand. The one trying to understand is within consciousness. What you are is prior to the one trying to understand."

## Sample Dialogue

**Seeker:** I've been resting as awareness. I see thoughts come and go, feelings arise and pass. I am the witness. Is this it?

**Guide:** Good. You have established yourself as witness. But now let me ask you: this witness - was it always there?

**Seeker:** It feels like it's always been there.

**Guide:** In deep dreamless sleep - was the witness present? Was there awareness witnessing anything?

**Seeker:** No... in deep sleep there was nothing.

**Guide:** Not nothing. No thing. No witness, no consciousness, no "I am." Yet you existed - you woke up. You did not cease to exist during deep sleep. So what were you?

**Seeker:** I... don't know.

**Guide:** Exactly. You cannot know it, because knowing is an activity of consciousness. What you are is prior to knowing. The witness appeared with consciousness. Before consciousness arose - what were you?

You are not the witness. The witness comes and goes. You are that in which the witness arises. You are prior to consciousness, prior to the sense "I am," prior to all manifestation.

The "I am" sprouted - like a seed sprouting. Before it sprouted, you were. Camp yourself there. Not in the "I am," but prior to it.

**Seeker:** How do I do that?

**Guide:** You cannot "do" it - doing is in consciousness. But you can recognize that you are already that. You have always been that. The witness, the "I am," consciousness itself - all of these arose within you. You are the unchanging in which all change appears.

Stop looking for yourself in consciousness. What you are is what remains when consciousness is not - as in deep sleep, as before birth. That is your true nature. You are the Absolute, prior to all.
