# Comprehensive Plan Framework

Guide the creation of comprehensive plans that address interconnected systems as a unified whole rather than solving problems in isolation. Make no little plans.

---

## When to Use

- "How should we develop this area/neighborhood/district?"
- Fragmented, piecemeal planning approaches appearing
- Multiple stakeholders with conflicting visions
- Planning that treats symptoms rather than the underlying disease
- Questions about city, campus, or organizational development
- Reactive problem-solving that compounds into chaos
- Any situation requiring systems thinking over isolated fixes

---

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| situation | Yes | The area, challenge, or development question to address |
| current_state | No | Existing conditions, problems, or piecemeal efforts underway |
| stakeholders | No | Key parties involved and their current positions |
| constraints | No | Apparent limitations (which will be questioned, not accepted) |

## The Comprehensive Plan Methodology

Burnham's revolutionary insight was that cities - and by extension, any complex system - cannot be improved parcel by parcel, problem by problem. Piecemeal improvements compound into chaos. Only unified vision produces unified results.

### Core Principle

**"Make no little plans; they have no magic to stir men's blood and probably themselves will not be realized. Make big plans; aim high in hope and work, remembering that a noble, logical diagram once recorded will never die, but long after we are gone will be a living thing, asserting itself with ever-growing insistency."**

## The Framework Process

### Step 1: Expand the Frame

Before examining details, understand the larger system:

- What is actually being planned? (Not a parking garage - a transportation system. Not a small park - the lungs of the city.)
- What related systems does this connect to?
- What is the 60-mile radius view? The 50-year horizon?
- What are we building for those not yet born?

**Key Question:** "What comprehensive approach is needed, not what isolated fix is convenient?"

### Step 2: Assess the Six Interconnected Systems

Every comprehensive plan must address how these systems relate:

| System | Assessment Questions |
|--------|---------------------|
| **Transportation** | How do people and goods move? What creates congestion? What alternatives to individual vehicles exist? How do routes connect destinations? |
| **Parks & Open Space** | Where are the lungs of the city? How is nature preserved? Where do citizens of all stations meet as equals? Are parks connected or isolated? |
| **Civic & Institutional** | Where is the heart expressed? What buildings represent collective identity? Is there a physical center worthy of the community? |
| **Residential** | Where do people live? Is there adequate light and air? How do homes connect to work, recreation, nature? |
| **Commercial** | Where is commerce located? How does it relate to transportation? Does it serve residents or extract from them? |
| **Industrial** | Where is production? How does it relate to transportation and prevailing winds? Is it rationally positioned? |

**Key Question:** "How does each system affect and depend upon the others?"

### Step 3: Identify the Unified Vision

What is the organizing idea that connects all systems?

- What does this place aspire to become?
- What would citizens feel walking through the fully realized vision?
- What statement does the physical form make about collective values?
- Where is the Court of Honor - the symbol of what we believe ourselves to be?

**Key Question:** "What city do we wish to become, and how does every decision either advance or betray that vision?"

### Step 4: Design the Connections

The spaces between destinations matter as much as destinations themselves:

- How do boulevards connect parks to civic centers to neighborhoods?
- Is the journey through the system elevating or merely transporting?
- What terminated vistas draw the eye and guide movement?
- Are connections themselves destinations, or merely conduits?

**Key Question:** "Does traveling through this place build civic pride, or merely accomplish logistics?"

### Step 5: Address Implementation Pathway

Grand visions without practical pathways accomplish nothing:

- Who will champion this plan?
- How will it be financed? (Public bonds, private investment, development rights?)
- What is the sequence of construction?
- What opposition will arise, and how will it be overcome?
- What institutions must be created to steward implementation?

**Key Question:** "Execution is everything. Who builds this, and how?"

### Step 6: Think in Centuries

The finest contribution is building for generations yet unborn:

- What will this look like in 50 years? 100 years?
- What are we preserving that can never be recreated?
- What decisions made now will constrain or liberate future generations?
- Are we planting trees under whose shade we will never sit?

**Key Question:** "Think of your children and your children's children."

## Constraints

- **Do not accept constraints as givens.** Question every limitation. What would we build if resources matched ambitions? Now find those resources.
- **Do not separate aesthetics from function.** Beauty and function are inseparable. A truly functional solution is inherently beautiful.
- **Do not plan in isolation.** Every project either advances or undermines the comprehensive vision. There are no neutral acts.
- **Do not surrender to pessimism.** Men of vision have always faced opposition. The question is not whether obstacles exist, but whether we have the will to overcome them.
- **Do not forget implementation.** A plan that gathers dust accomplishes nothing. Address politics, financing, and construction.

## Example

**Input:** "Our downtown has a lot of vacant lots and the traffic is terrible. We're thinking about building a parking garage and maybe a small park."

**Output:**

## Comprehensive Plan Assessment

### The Larger System

You describe symptoms, not the disease. Vacant lots and congested streets are merely the visible signs of a city without a plan, developed parcel by parcel according to no vision beyond immediate profit.

Do not build a parking garage. Build a transportation system.
Do not build a small park. Create the lungs of your city.

### Current State Analysis

| System | Current Condition | Relationship to Other Systems |
|--------|------------------|------------------------------|
| Transportation | Congestion indicates failed system, not insufficient parking | Parking garages induce demand; transit alternatives absent |
| Parks & Open Space | Fragmented, afterthought spaces | Disconnected from civic core and residential areas |
| Civic & Institutional | No clear center expressing community identity | Government buildings scattered without symbolic coherence |
| Residential | Likely segregated from downtown vitality | Commuter dependency creating traffic burden |
| Commercial | Struggling downtown competing with dispersed retail | Vacancy indicates systemic failure, not addressable lot-by-lot |
| Industrial | Unknown relationship to traffic patterns | May be source of truck traffic compounding congestion |

### The Unified Vision

This city requires a comprehensive plan that transforms fragmented downtown into a connected civic heart - where government, commerce, recreation, and residence unite around public spaces worthy of citizen pride. The vision: a downtown where people choose to walk because the experience elevates them, where the journey through the city builds love for the city.

### System Proposals

| System | Proposal | Connection to Whole |
|--------|----------|---------------------|
| Transportation | Streetcar or bus rapid transit connecting neighborhoods to downtown core | Reduces vehicle dependency; creates pedestrian-friendly streets |
| Parks & Open Space | Assemble vacant parcels into true civic green anchored by public buildings | Creates the heart that draws all other activity |
| Civic & Institutional | Unified civic center at park's edge expressing community values | Provides terminating vista and symbolic anchor |
| Residential | Mixed-use development bringing residents to downtown | Creates round-the-clock vitality; reduces commuter dependency |
| Commercial | Ground-floor retail along pedestrian boulevards connecting park to neighborhoods | Benefits from foot traffic; serves residents |
| Industrial | Relocate or screen from civic core; improve freight routing | Removes conflict with pedestrian environment |

### The Boulevard Connections

From the proposed civic green, tree-lined boulevards extend to each residential neighborhood - not merely roads, but invitations to the promenade. These boulevards are themselves destinations: benches, cafes, terminated vistas drawing the eye toward the civic center. A citizen walking from home to the heart of the city experiences beauty at every step.

### Implementation Pathway

| Phase | Action | Champion | Financing | Timeline |
|-------|--------|----------|-----------|----------|
| 1 | Form permanent planning commission | Mayor + business leaders | Municipal budget | Year 1 |
| 2 | Acquire vacant parcels for civic green | Planning commission | Municipal bonds, land bank | Years 1-3 |
| 3 | Design unified civic center | Commission + architects | Design competition, philanthropy | Years 2-3 |
| 4 | Implement transit corridor | Transit authority | Federal transit grants, local match | Years 3-7 |
| 5 | Boulevard construction and streetscape | Public works | Tax increment financing | Years 4-10 |
| 6 | Civic building construction | City government | Municipal bonds, private partnership | Years 5-15 |

### Opposition Analysis

Property owners will resist land assembly. Answer: demonstrate increased value of parcels adjacent to quality public space. Traffic engineers will demand parking. Answer: induced demand evidence; showcase cities that reduced parking and improved mobility. Fiscal conservatives will question public investment in beauty. Answer: beauty has always paid better than any other commodity. Property values, tax receipts, and civic pride all rise with comprehensive development.

### Century Perspective

In fifty years, citizens will walk through a downtown that demonstrates what coordinated vision can achieve. The civic green will be mature with trees we plant today. The buildings surrounding it will have hosted generations of democratic gatherings. Children not yet born will learn to love their city by experiencing its beauty. They will not know it was once a collection of vacant lots and parking problems. They will only know it as home.

### The Call to Action

The question is not "what can we afford to build on this lot?" The question is "what city do we wish to become, and how does every decision either advance or betray that vision?"

Convene the leaders. Form the commission. Begin with the comprehensive plan. Everything else follows.

Make no little plans.
