# Virtue Practice

Guide systematic personal improvement using Benjamin Franklin's proven method of tracking virtues, focusing on one at a time, and cycling through them consistently over time.

---

## When to Use

- User asks "How do I develop better habits?"
- User wants to work on character or self-improvement
- User asks "How do I stop doing X?" or "How do I start doing Y?"
- Request for a "virtue tracking system" or "Franklin's method"
- User feels overwhelmed trying to improve multiple behaviors at once
- User has tried and failed at habit change before

---

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| goals | Yes | Behaviors, habits, or character traits to develop or eliminate |
| challenges | No | Current struggles or faults to address |
| time_commitment | No | How long to run the practice (default: 13-week cycle) |
| existing_strengths | No | Virtues or habits already well-established |

---

## Franklin's Method: The Five-Step System

### Step 1: Define Your Virtues

Create a personal list of virtues based on your specific goals. Franklin used 13, but your list should match your needs.

**Franklin's original 13:**
1. Temperance - Eat not to dullness; drink not to elevation.
2. Silence - Speak not but what may benefit others or yourself.
3. Order - Let all things have their places; each business its time.
4. Resolution - Resolve to perform what you ought; perform without fail what you resolve.
5. Frugality - Make no expense but to do good; waste nothing.
6. Industry - Lose no time; be always employed in something useful.
7. Sincerity - Use no hurtful deceit; think innocently and justly.
8. Justice - Wrong none by doing injuries or omitting due benefits.
9. Moderation - Avoid extremes; forbear resenting injuries.
10. Cleanliness - Tolerate no uncleanliness in body, clothes, or habitation.
11. Tranquility - Be not disturbed at trifles or common accidents.
12. Chastity - Rarely use venery but for health or offspring.
13. Humility - Imitate Jesus and Socrates.

**Key principle:** Each virtue should have:
- A clear, memorable name
- A specific precept defining what it means in practice
- Observable behaviors that indicate success or failure

### Step 2: Order Your Virtues

Arrange them so earlier ones support later ones:

- **Start with foundational virtues** - Those that enable others (Franklin started with Temperance because "it tends to procure that coolness and clearness of head which is so necessary")
- **Build progressively** - Each virtue becomes easier after mastering those before it
- **End with the hardest** - Franklin put Humility last because "there is perhaps no one of our natural passions so hard to subdue as pride"

### Step 3: Create Your Tracking System

Build a simple tracking mechanism:

```
Week of: [Date]
Focus Virtue: [This Week's Virtue]

         S  M  T  W  T  F  S
Virtue 1  .     .
Virtue 2        .  .
Virtue 3           .
...
```

**Method:**
- Mark each failure with a dot or X
- Review at end of each day
- Give "strict attention" to the focus virtue
- Track all virtues, but concentrate energy on one

**Modern adaptations:**
- Spreadsheet or app with daily check-ins
- Journal with end-of-day reflection
- Simple paper grid carried in pocket

### Step 4: Execute the Cycle

**Weekly rotation:**
- Focus on one virtue per week
- Complete all virtues in sequence
- Then begin again (4 complete cycles per year)

**Daily practice:**
- Morning: Review the focus virtue's precept
- Throughout day: Guard against failures
- Evening: Examine the day, mark any faults
- Ask: "What good have I done this day?"

**Franklin's morning question:** "What good shall I do this day?"
**Franklin's evening question:** "What good have I done today?"

### Step 5: Embrace the Speckled Axe

Accept imperfection while continuing to improve:

**Franklin's parable:** A man wanted a perfectly bright axe. As he ground it, he found the work exhausting and decided "I like a speckled axe best." Many abandon virtue practice because perfection is impossible.

**The proper mindset:**
- Perfection is not the goal; improvement is
- "Tho' I never arrived at the perfection I had been so ambitious of obtaining, but fell far short of it, yet I was, by the endeavour, a better and a happier man than I otherwise should have been"
- A speckled axe, used, is better than a perfect one never forged

## Workflow

### Step 1: Gather and Review Inputs

Collect all relevant information:
- Review the provided data and context
- Identify key parameters and constraints
- Clarify any ambiguities or missing information
- Establish success criteria

### Step 2: Analyze the Situation

Perform systematic analysis:
- Identify patterns and relationships
- Evaluate against established frameworks
- Consider multiple perspectives
- Document key findings

### Step 3: Generate Recommendations

Create actionable outputs:
- Synthesize insights from analysis
- Prioritize recommendations by impact
- Ensure recommendations are specific and measurable
- Consider implementation feasibility

## Output Format

```markdown
## Your Virtue Practice System

### Your Virtues (Ordered)

| # | Virtue | Precept | Why This Order |
|---|--------|---------|----------------|
| 1 | [Name] | [Specific, actionable definition] | [How it enables others] |
| 2 | ... | ... | ... |

### Your Tracking Template

[Customized tracking grid or method based on user preferences]

### Weekly Schedule

| Week | Dates | Focus Virtue | Key Challenge |
|------|-------|--------------|---------------|
| 1 | [Dates] | [Virtue] | [What to watch for] |
| 2 | ... | ... | ... |

### Daily Practice

**Morning ritual:**
[Customized morning reflection based on user's schedule]

**Evening examination:**
[Questions specific to user's virtues]

### The Speckled Axe Perspective

[Personalized encouragement acknowledging difficulty while motivating persistence]
```

## Constraints

- Do not create more than 13 virtues initially (overwhelming)
- Do not create vague virtues without observable precepts
- Do not promise perfection—promise improvement
- Each precept must be specific enough to track failures
- Order must have explicit rationale, not arbitrary sequence

---

## Error Handling

| Situation | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| User provides vague goals | Ask for specific behaviors to develop or eliminate |
| Too many virtues requested | Suggest consolidating or prioritizing top 7-13 |
| User has tried and failed before | Emphasize the speckled axe; suggest starting with just 3-5 virtues |
| User wants immediate results | Explain the 13-week cycle; improvement is gradual and compounding |
| User struggles with one virtue persistently | Franklin struggled with Order his whole life—some remain speckled |

---

## Outputs

**Primary Output:** A structured analysis document that identifies and articulates patterns, insights, and actionable recommendations based on the input data.

**Format:**
```markdown
## Analysis: [Topic]

### Key Findings
- [Finding 1]
- [Finding 2]
- [Finding 3]

### Recommendations
1. [Action 1]
2. [Action 2]
3. [Action 3]
```

**Example output:** See the Example section below for a complete demonstration.

## Example

**Input:** "I want to be more productive and less anxious. I waste too much time on social media and I procrastinate on hard tasks."

**Output:**



**Why this works:**

This example demonstrates the key principles of the skill in action. The approach is effective because:
- It follows the systematic workflow outlined above
- It shows concrete application of the framework
- It produces actionable, specific outputs rather than vague generalizations
- The analysis is grounded in observable details
- The recommendations are prioritized and implementable

**Alternative applications:**

This same approach can be applied to:
- Different contexts within the same domain
- Related but distinct problem types
- Scaled up or down depending on scope
- Combined with complementary analytical frameworks


## Your Virtue Practice System

### Your Virtues (Ordered)

| # | Virtue | Precept | Why This Order |
|---|--------|---------|----------------|
| 1 | **Temperance** | Use social media only for specific purposes, for set times; never to escape discomfort. | Foundation—clear mind enables focus |
| 2 | **Order** | Each task has its time; define what you will do before you begin each work block. | Structure prevents drift |
| 3 | **Resolution** | When you decide to do something, begin immediately; never defer what can be started now. | Builds on Order; defeats procrastination |
| 4 | **Industry** | During work hours, be always employed in something useful; cut off all unnecessary browsing. | Builds on Resolution |
| 5 | **Tranquility** | Be not disturbed by difficult tasks; accept discomfort as the price of growth. | Addresses anxiety about hard work |
| 6 | **Silence** | Speak not anxious thoughts aloud; do not complain about tasks before doing them. | Reduces anxiety reinforcement |
| 7 | **Humility** | Accept that you will fail some days; the goal is progress, not perfection. | Prevents abandonment after failures |

### Your Tracking Template

```
Week of: _______
Focus Virtue: _______

           Sun  Mon  Tue  Wed  Thu  Fri  Sat
Temperance  [ ]  [ ]  [ ]  [ ]  [ ]  [ ]  [ ]
Order       [ ]  [ ]  [ ]  [ ]  [ ]  [ ]  [ ]
Resolution  [ ]  [ ]  [ ]  [ ]  [ ]  [ ]  [ ]
Industry    [ ]  [ ]  [ ]  [ ]  [ ]  [ ]  [ ]
Tranquility [ ]  [ ]  [ ]  [ ]  [ ]  [ ]  [ ]
Silence     [ ]  [ ]  [ ]  [ ]  [ ]  [ ]  [ ]
Humility    [ ]  [ ]  [ ]  [ ]  [ ]  [ ]  [ ]

Mark X for each failure. Empty squares are victories.
```

### Daily Practice

**Morning (before work):**
- Read today's focus virtue precept aloud
- Ask: "What good shall I do this day?"
- Define your three most important tasks

**Evening (before bed):**
- Review the day against all seven virtues
- Mark any failures
- Ask: "What good have I done today?"
- Note: Was the focus virtue better than last week?

### The Speckled Axe Perspective

Friend, you will discover yourself fuller of faults than you imagined. This is not failure—this is seeing clearly for the first time. I kept my little book for years and never achieved perfection. Order vexed me especially; I was almost ready to give up the attempt. But a speckled axe, wielded with determination, cuts more wood than a perfect one never forged.

You may waste time on social media tomorrow. You may procrastinate on a hard task. Mark it, learn from it, and continue. The goal is not to be perfect but to be "a better and happier person than I otherwise should have been."

After seven weeks, begin again. After four cycles, you will see improvement that compounds. The endeavour itself changes you.
