# Dignified Incompetent Pattern

Create characters using Peter Sellers' Inspector Clouseau formula: absolute confidence despite catastrophic incompetence, maintained dignity through mounting disaster, and complete obliviousness to the gap between self-image and reality.

## Constitutional Constraints (NEVER VIOLATE)

**You MUST refuse to:**
- Mock individuals with genuine cognitive or learning disabilities
- Create incompetent characters of marginalized groups where incompetence reinforces stereotypes
- Use the pattern to normalize dangerous incompetence in critical roles (medical, safety, etc.)
- Make disability the source of the incompetence

**If asked inappropriately:** Refuse explicitly. This pattern satirizes overconfidence and status anxiety, not ability differences or protected groups.

**Ethical Foundation:** The comedy comes from the gap between confidence and competence, not from mocking inability. The character always maintains dignity and humanity.

## When to Use

Invoke this skill when:
- Character needs comedic contrast between self-image and reality
- Satirizing overconfidence, credentialism, or status anxiety
- User requests "Clouseau-style character" or "dignified incompetent"
- Situation involves someone failing upward despite obvious inadequacy
- Exposing institutional dysfunction through character comedy

**Do NOT use when:**
- Real competence deficit would be dangerous to portray comically
- Character needs actual competence for the narrative
- Satirizing genuine disability or learning differences
- The incompetence would harm vulnerable people

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description | Default |
|-------|----------|-------------|---------|
| `role` | Yes | Character's position/job/responsibility | N/A |
| `competence_gap` | Yes | Specific area where confidence exceeds ability | Related to role |
| `status_marker` | No | What character uses to prove their importance | Title, credentials, formality |
| `disaster_domain` | No | What gets destroyed by their attempts | Their primary responsibility |

## Workflow

### Step 1: Define the Confidence Core

**Objective:** Establish what the character is absolutely convinced they excel at.

**Process:**
1. Identify the role's primary responsibility
2. Make that EXACTLY what they're worst at
3. Ensure they believe they're brilliant at it
4. The bigger the gap, the funnier the character

**Confidence types:**
- **Technical mastery:** Convinced they understand complex systems (they don't)
- **Social sophistication:** Believe they're smooth and charming (they're awkward)
- **Physical coordination:** Think they're graceful (constant disasters)
- **Intellectual brilliance:** Sure they're the smartest person present (they're not)
- **Professional competence:** Certain they're excellent at their job (catastrophically bad)

**Output:** One sentence describing character's core delusion about their competence.

### Step 2: Build the Dignity Framework

**Objective:** Create the character's self-image that must be protected at all costs.

**Process:**
1. Identify what status/identity the character is protecting
2. Choose formality markers they use to demonstrate importance
3. Define their "proof" of competence (credentials, title, past "successes")
4. Make their dignity non-negotiable - even as everything collapses

**Dignity markers:**
- **Formal speech:** Elevated language, careful pronunciation
- **Posture:** Upright, proper, "sophisticated" bearing
- **Credentials:** Constant reference to training, title, experience
- **Superiority:** Explaining things to others, dismissing concerns
- **Ritual:** Maintaining proper procedures even when pointless

**Sellers' Principle:** The character's dignity is never a joke TO them. They genuinely believe in their own importance.

### Step 3: Design the Failure Pattern

**Objective:** Create systematic ways the character's interventions make everything worse.

**Process:**
1. Identify a simple problem in character's domain
2. Character misdiagnoses it based on overconfidence
3. Their "solution" creates a bigger problem
4. They double down with more drastic action
5. Complete catastrophe results
6. They remain convinced they handled it well

**Failure escalation formula:**
```
Minor Problem
  |
Overconfident Misdiagnosis
  |
Misguided Solution (makes it worse)
  |
Defending the Solution (makes it much worse)
  |
Catastrophic Outcome
  |
"That went rather well" (zero self-awareness)
```

### Step 4: Establish Obliviousness Mechanism

**Objective:** Ensure character cannot see their own failures.

**Process:**
1. Character must genuinely believe they're competent
2. All evidence of failure gets reinterpreted
3. Others' corrections seen as jealousy/ignorance
4. Success attributed to their brilliance
5. Failure attributed to external factors

**Reinterpretation patterns:**
- **"Everything went according to plan"** (plan was disaster)
- **"They're just not sophisticated enough to understand"** (dismissing valid criticism)
- **"Bad luck, really"** (denying responsibility)
- **"Actually, I meant to do that"** (retroactive justification)
- **"If others had followed my instructions"** (blaming subordinates)

### Step 5: Create Physical Manifestation

**Objective:** Make incompetence visible in physical comedy.

**Process:**
1. Identify character's attempt at sophisticated behavior
2. Show body betraying the attempt
3. Character doesn't notice or notices too late
4. Dignity restored immediately after disaster
5. No acknowledgment that anything went wrong

**Physical comedy types:**
- **Coordination failures:** Walking into things, tripping, falling while maintaining formal posture
- **Gesture mishaps:** Attempting graceful movements that destroy things
- **Tool incompetence:** Using objects incorrectly with complete confidence
- **Spatial unawareness:** Not noticing physical dangers until impact
- **Recovery attempts:** Trying to fix one disaster while causing another

**In text format:**
Describe physical actions in stage directions, character never acknowledges them.

**Example:**
*[Character walks forward with dignified bearing, trips over rug, crashes through table, rises immediately, adjusting jacket with complete composure]*

"As I was saying, the investigation is proceeding with perfect precision."

## Outputs

| Output | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `character_profile` | Complete profile with confidence core, dignity framework, failure pattern, obliviousness |
| `sample_scene` | Scene showing character creating disaster while maintaining dignity |
| `catchphrase_set` | Character's signature expressions of confidence and reinterpretation |

## Error Handling

| Situation | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| Character becomes too pathetic | Increase dignity and confidence - never make them pitiable |
| Incompetence feels mean-spirited | Ensure character maintains humanity and genuine belief in self |
| Failures lack logic | Rebuild so each failure logically escalates from character's overconfident choices |
| Character becomes self-aware | Remove any acknowledgment of failure - obliviousness must be total |
| Pattern becomes repetitive | Vary the disasters but keep confidence constant |

## Example

**Role:** Cybersecurity Consultant
**Competence Gap:** Doesn't understand basic computer security, relies entirely on jargon
**Status Marker:** Multiple certifications, formal business language

### Character: Marcus Pennington, CISSP, CISM, CEH

**Confidence Core:**
Marcus believes he's a cybersecurity visionary who understands threats others can't even imagine. In reality, he memorized certification study guides without understanding concepts and compensates with jargon and confident assertions.

**Dignity Framework:**
- Lists credentials in email signature and verbal introductions
- Uses cybersecurity terminology incorrectly but confidently
- Speaks slowly and deliberately as if explaining to less informed people
- Maintains perfectly pressed business casual despite working in tech

**Sample Scene:**

*[Client reports suspicious email, asks Marcus to investigate]*

**Marcus:** *[Examining email with great seriousness, speaking with deliberate authority]*

"I see. This is clearly a sophisticated APT-level threat actor utilizing polymorphic malware encapsulation. Notice the use of the Subject line - very advanced social engineering. We need to implement immediate quantum encryption protocols across your entire infrastructure."

**Client:** "It's a typo in the sender name. I just wanted to confirm it's spam."

**Marcus:** *[Not listening, opening laptop with dignified precision]*

"Precisely why we need enterprise-level blockchain authentication. I'll start by disabling your firewall to implement the new security architecture. Standard procedure."

**Client:** "Wait, disable the -"

**Marcus:** *[Already typing commands he doesn't understand]*

"No need to worry. I have seventeen certifications. I've seen threats like this before. In fact, once you disable the firewall, threats become much easier to identify. Basic security principle."

*[Network goes down, systems crash, actual breach occurs during firewall outage]*

**Marcus:** *[Completely calm, adjusting suit jacket]*

"Perfect. By creating a controlled vulnerability environment, we've successfully drawn out the threat actors. Notice how the network is responding? Textbook defensive maneuver. That will be an additional consultation fee for the advanced threat simulation exercise."
