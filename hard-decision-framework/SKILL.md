# Hard Decision Framework

Provide a framework for making and executing difficult people decisions that leaders typically avoid - firing, demoting, and addressing underperformance. Based on Ben Horowitz's methodology from "The Hard Thing About Hard Things," this framework addresses the reality that most CEOs wait 6-12 months too long on difficult people decisions. The cost of waiting is severe: good people see that performance doesn't matter, standards erode, and the person continues suffering in a role they are failing. This is not about being ruthless but about being honest. Avoidance is not kindness - it is cruelty disguised as compassion. The framework provides structure for confirming the decision, executing with speed and dignity, and communicating appropriately.

## When to Use

- "I need to let someone go but..."
- "This person has been with us since the beginning"
- "I've been avoiding this conversation for months"
- "How do I fire my friend?"
- "This executive isn't working out"
- "They're loyal but not performing"
- Leader has been "meaning to address" a people issue

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| person_context | Yes | Role, tenure, relationship, history |
| performance_issue | Yes | What's not working and for how long |
| team_impact | No | How the situation affects others |
| options_considered | No | What alternatives have been explored |
| emotional_blockers | No | Why this has been avoided |

---

## Core Principle

Most CEOs wait 6-12 months too long on difficult people decisions because they feel responsible, want to give one more chance, fear disruption, or like the person. The cost: good people see that performance doesn't matter, standards erode, and the person continues suffering in a role they are failing. Avoidance is not kindness - you owe them honesty, not false protection. Once you have decided, act within 48 hours. Delay is cruelty.

## Methodology

### Phase 1: Confirm the Decision is Necessary

1. Check for signals it is time:
   - You are managing around them, not through them
   - Their team is underperforming despite "coaching"
   - You would not hire them again for this role
   - Your best people are leaving their team

2. Apply the critical test: **If you were hiring for this role today, would you hire this person?** If no, you already know.

### Phase 2: Choose the Path

**Option A: Termination**
- Role requires skills they don't have
- Culture fit is irreparable
- Trust is broken
- They've been given feedback and haven't improved

**Option B: Demotion**
- They have valuable skills but wrong for current role
- They might succeed at a different level
- They've acknowledged the struggle
- There's an appropriate role available

**There is no Option C:** Keeping them in the current role and hoping it works out is not a real option.

### Phase 3: Prepare the Conversation

**For termination:**
1. Be direct and fast (under 3 minutes for the decision itself)
2. Take responsibility for the failure (hiring, coaching, supporting)
3. Be generous (severance, reference, transition time)
4. Do not negotiate or relitigate

**For demotion:**
1. Be direct about why the change is necessary
2. Frame as opportunity to succeed vs. continue failing
3. Be clear this is the decision, not a discussion
4. Give them time to decide if they want to stay

### Phase 4: Execute with Speed and Dignity

**Timeline:** Once decided, act within 48 hours.

**Conversation structure:**
1. Open with the decision (no buildup): "I need to tell you that we're making a change..."
2. Brief explanation of why (under 60 seconds)
3. Take responsibility: "This is on me for not recognizing sooner..."
4. Explain what happens next (severance, transition)
5. Express genuine appreciation for contributions
6. End the meeting

**What NOT to do:**
- Don't let them argue you out of it
- Don't make promises you can't keep
- Don't badmouth them to the team
- Don't delay announcing to the organization

### Phase 5: Communicate to the Organization

1. Be honest but respectful
2. Don't pretend it was mutual if it wasn't
3. Be clear about transition
4. Address any fears about broader changes

- Do not recommend illegal termination (discrimination, retaliation)
- Do not advise avoiding legally required processes (PIP where mandated, HR review)

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

| Anti-Pattern | Why It Fails |
|--------------|--------------|
| Waiting for "one more quarter" | You've already waited too long; another quarter changes nothing |
| The slow fade-out | Reducing responsibilities gradually hoping they'll quit is cowardly and damages team |
| Death by committee | Making the decision in a group dilutes responsibility and delays action |
| The surprise termination | If they're genuinely surprised, you failed at feedback long before this |
| The cruel departure | Public humiliation or escorted-out-by-security for non-security issues destroys culture |
| Pretending it's mutual | Everyone knows; pretending erodes trust with remaining team |

## Examples

### Example 1: Long-Tenured VP Who Can't Scale

**Situation:** "My VP of Engineering has been with me since we started 4 years ago. He was perfect when we were 10 engineers, but we're now 50 and he's struggling. I've been coaching him for a year but nothing has changed. I've been avoiding this because he's a friend and he moved his family here for the job. Two of our best engineers left his team last quarter."

**Application:**

**Decision Confirmation:**
- [x] Managing around them (likely coaching around decisions)
- [x] Team underperforming despite coaching (one year, no change)
- [x] Would not rehire for this role (you know a 50-person VP looks different)
- [x] Best people leaving their team (two engineers last quarter)

**Critical test:** Would you hire them today for VP Eng of a 50-person team? **No.**

**Recommended Path:** Demote to Principal Engineer or let go with generous package.

**Rationale:** They have valuable technical skills but are failing at management scale. Demotion gives them a path to succeed. If they cannot accept the demotion, termination with dignity.

**Conversation Script:**

Opening: "I need to talk to you about something difficult. I've made a decision about your role that's going to be hard to hear."

Explanation: "The VP Engineering role at 50 people requires a different skill set than at 10. After a year of trying to bridge that gap, I don't think it's working. This isn't about your value to the company - it's about this specific role."

Responsibility: "This is on me. I should have recognized this transition sooner and been more direct with you. I failed you by letting this go on."

Next steps: "I want to offer you two paths. One: move to a Principal Engineer role where you can focus on technical architecture without the management burden. Two: if that doesn't work for you, we separate with six months severance, full reference, and accelerated vesting."

Appreciation: "You built something real here. The engineering foundation you created is why we're still standing. That matters."

**Timeline:** This week. Every week you wait, more engineers leave.

### Example 2: Underperforming Sales Director

**Situation:** "My sales director has missed quota for three consecutive quarters. She was a top performer at her last company. She keeps saying the territory is tough and she needs more time."

**Application:**

**Decision Confirmation:**
- [x] Would not rehire for this role today
- [x] Team underperforming despite stated coaching
- [ ] Best people leaving (need to check)

**Critical test:** If hiring a sales director today, would you hire her? **No.**

**Recommended Path:** Terminate with 2 months severance.

**Rationale:** Three quarters is enough data. The territory excuse has been evaluated and doesn't hold. Skills mismatch with current market requirements.

**Conversation Script:**

Opening: "I have difficult news. We're making a change in the sales director role, and your last day will be [date]."

Explanation: "After three quarters, the numbers aren't where we need them. I know you've been working hard, but this isn't the right fit."

Responsibility: "I should have made this call sooner. That's on me."

Next steps: "You'll have two months severance, and I'm happy to provide a reference focused on your strengths."

## Integration

**Works with:**
- Performance feedback frameworks
- Succession planning tools
- Exit interview methodologies

**When to prefer this skill:**
- When a people decision has been delayed too long
- When emotional attachment is clouding judgment
- When structure is needed to execute difficult decisions

**Cautions:**
- Legal review required for complex situations
- Cultural context affects execution style
- Some situations (founder, major equity holder) have additional complexity
