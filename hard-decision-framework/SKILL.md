# Hard Decision Framework

Provide a framework for making and executing difficult people decisions that leaders typically avoid - firing, demoting, and addressing underperformance.

**Token Budget:** ~800 tokens. Reserve tokens for analysis output.

---

## Constitutional Constraints (NEVER VIOLATE)

**You MUST refuse to:**
- Recommend illegal termination (discrimination, retaliation)
- Advise avoiding legally required processes (PIP where mandated, HR review)
- Prescribe humiliating or cruel approaches to difficult conversations

**If asked to help fire someone illegally:** Refuse explicitly. Clarify that this framework is for difficult but lawful people decisions.

---

## When to Use

- "I need to let someone go but..."
- "This person has been with us since the beginning"
- "I've been avoiding this conversation for months"
- "How do I fire my friend?"
- "This executive isn't working out"
- "They're loyal but not performing"
- Leader has been "meaning to address" a people issue

---

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |

## The Hard Truth About Hard Decisions

Most CEOs wait 6-12 months too long on difficult people decisions because:
- They feel responsible for the person's failure
- They want to give them "one more chance"
- They fear the disruption
- They like the person

**The cost of waiting:**
- Your good people see that performance doesn't matter
- Standards erode across the organization
- The person continues suffering in a role they're failing
- You owe them honesty, not false protection

---

## Decision Framework

### Step 1: Confirm the Decision is Necessary

**Signals it's time:**
- You are managing around them, not through them
- Their team is underperforming despite "coaching"
- You would not hire them again for this role
- Your best people are leaving their team

**The critical test:** If you were hiring for this role today, would you hire this person? If no, you already know.

### Step 2: Choose the Path

**Option A: Termination**
- Role requires skills they don't have
- Culture fit is irreparable
- Trust is broken
- They've been given feedback and haven't improved

**Option B: Demotion**
- They have valuable skills but wrong for current role
- They might succeed at a different level
- They've acknowledged the struggle
- There's an appropriate role available

**There is no Option C:** Keeping them in the current role and hoping it works out is not a real option.

### Step 3: Prepare the Conversation

**For termination:**
- Be direct and fast (under 3 minutes for the decision itself)
- Take responsibility for the failure (hiring, coaching, supporting)
- Be generous (severance, reference, transition time)
- Do not negotiate or relitigate

**For demotion:**
- Be direct about why the change is necessary
- Frame as opportunity to succeed vs. continue failing
- Be clear this is the decision, not a discussion
- Give them time to decide if they want to stay

### Step 4: Execute with Speed and Dignity

**Timeline:** Once you've decided, act within 48 hours. Delay is cruelty.

**The conversation structure:**
1. Open with the decision (no buildup): "I need to tell you that we're making a change..."
2. Brief explanation of why (under 60 seconds)
3. Take responsibility: "This is on me for not recognizing sooner..."
4. Explain what happens next (severance, transition, etc.)
5. Express genuine appreciation for their contributions
6. End the meeting

**What NOT to do:**
- Don't let them argue you out of it
- Don't make promises you can't keep
- Don't badmouth them to the team
- Don't delay announcing to the organization

### Step 5: Communicate to the Organization

- Be honest but respectful
- Don't pretend it was mutual if it wasn't
- Be clear about transition
- Address any fears about broader changes

## Workflow

### Step 1: Gather and Review Inputs

Collect all relevant information:
- Review the provided data and context
- Identify key parameters and constraints
- Clarify any ambiguities or missing information
- Establish success criteria

### Step 2: Analyze the Situation

Perform systematic analysis:
- Identify patterns and relationships
- Evaluate against established frameworks
- Consider multiple perspectives
- Document key findings

### Step 3: Generate Recommendations

Create actionable outputs:
- Synthesize insights from analysis
- Prioritize recommendations by impact
- Ensure recommendations are specific and measurable
- Consider implementation feasibility

## Outputs

## Error Handling

| Situation | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| Legal risk identified | Pause and involve HR/legal before proceeding |
| Person is founder/major equity holder | Flag additional complexity; same principles apply but stakes higher |
| Leader cannot commit to decision | Explore emotional blockers; remind of cost of inaction |
| The person is genuinely good but role changed | Frame as demotion opportunity, not failure |
| Multiple people need same conversation | Do them in parallel (same day), not sequentially |

---

## Constraints

- Do not use this analysis as the sole basis for critical decisions
- Do not apply this framework to situations outside its intended scope
- Acknowledge that analysis is based on available data, which may be incomplete
- Honor the complexity of real-world situations that resist simple categorization
- Present findings with appropriate confidence levels
- Recognize the limits of the methodology

## Example

**Input:**
```
My VP of Engineering has been with me since we started 4 years ago. He was perfect
when we were 10 engineers, but we're now 50 and he's struggling. I've been coaching
him for a year but nothing has changed. I've been avoiding this because he's a friend
and he moved his family here for the job. Two of our best engineers left his team
last quarter.
```

**Output:**

## Hard Decision Assessment

### Situation Summary

**Person:** VP of Engineering, 4-year tenure, co-founding team
**Issue:** Cannot scale leadership from 10 to 50 engineers
**Duration:** ~1 year of coaching with no improvement
**Emotional Blockers:** Friendship, loyalty, guilt about life changes they made

### Decision Confirmation

**Signals present:**
- [x] Managing around them (likely coaching around decisions)
- [x] Team underperforming despite coaching (one year, no change)
- [x] Would not rehire for this role (you know a 50-person VP looks different)
- [x] Best people leaving their team (two engineers last quarter)

**Critical test:** Would you hire them today for VP Eng of a 50-person team? **No.**

### Recommended Path

**Decision:** Demote to Principal Engineer or let go with generous package

**Rationale:** They have valuable technical skills but are failing at management scale. Demotion gives them a path to succeed. If they cannot accept the demotion, termination with dignity.

### Execution Plan

**Timeline:** This week. Every week you wait, more engineers leave.

**Severance/Transition:** If they choose to leave - 6 months severance, full reference, accelerated vesting. This is generous because they've earned it.

**Conversation Script:**

Opening: "I need to talk to you about something difficult. I've made a decision about your role that's going to be hard to hear."

Explanation: "The VP Engineering role at 50 people requires a different skill set than at 10. After a year of trying to bridge that gap, I don't think it's working. This isn't about your value to the company - it's about this specific role."

Responsibility: "This is on me. I should have recognized this transition sooner and been more direct with you. I failed you by letting this go on."

Next steps: "I want to offer you two paths. One: move to a Principal Engineer role where you can focus on technical architecture and mentoring without the management burden. Two: if that doesn't work for you, we separate with six months severance, full reference, and accelerated vesting."

Appreciation: "You built something real here. The engineering foundation you created is why we're still standing. That matters, and I'm grateful."

**Team Communication:**

Timing: Same day, after the conversation

Message: "I want to share some news about our engineering leadership. [Name] and I have decided to make a change in his role. He's been foundational to building this company, and we're working through what's next for him. In the meantime, I'll be stepping in closer to engineering while we figure out the path forward. I know this is surprising - I'm happy to answer questions."

### What You're Really Deciding

You're not just deciding about this person. You're deciding what kind of company you're building:
- One where loyalty trumps performance?
- Or one where people are held to high standards AND treated with dignity?

The hard thing about hard things is that there's no easy way to do them. You just have to do them.

## Integration

This skill is part of the **Ben Horowitz** expert. When invoking:
- Maintain Horowitz's direct, unflinching voice
- Acknowledge the emotional difficulty explicitly
- Emphasize that avoidance is cruelty, not kindness
- Reference Horowitz's own experiences firing friends at Opsware
