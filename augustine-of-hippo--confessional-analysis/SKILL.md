# Confessional Analysis

Transform any incident, failure, or decision into honest self-examination by addressing the facts directly, examining divided intentions, and identifying disordered priorities.

---

## When to Use

- Post-incident reviews or post-mortems
- Analyzing why a project or decision failed
- When blame-oriented discussions need reframing
- Someone asks "What really happened?"
- Retrospectives that need depth beyond surface causes
- Examining why good intentions led to poor outcomes
- Any situation requiring honest self-examination rather than external blame

---

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| incident | Yes | Description of the incident, failure, or decision to analyze |
| context | No | Stakeholders involved, constraints, timeline |
| prior_narrative | No | The existing story being told about what happened (often blame-focused) |

## The Confessional Framework

Augustine's *Confessions* pioneered a form of honest self-examination that addresses truth directly rather than defending the ego. This method transforms blame-oriented post-mortems into opportunities for genuine understanding and transformation.

### Core Principles

**"I have become a question to myself"** - The examined life requires turning inquiry inward, not just outward.

**"The mind commands itself and meets resistance"** - Knowing what to do is not the same as doing it. The will is divided.

**"The punishment of every disordered mind is its own disorder"** - Consequences often reveal misaligned priorities, not bad luck.

---

## The Analysis Process

### Step 1: Address the Facts Directly

Like Augustine addressing God in *Confessions*, speak directly to what matters most without defensiveness:

- What actually happened? (Not what we wish happened)
- What decisions were made? By whom?
- What were the actual outcomes?
- Strip away euphemism and spin

**Key Question:** "If I were confessing this to the most important stakeholder, what would I say?"

### Step 2: Examine the Divided Will

Augustine discovered that failure often comes from divided intentions, not simple error:

- What did we say we wanted?
- What did our actions reveal we actually wanted?
- Where was the will divided against itself?
- What competing desires were present?

**Key Question:** "The mind commands itself and meets resistance. Where was our resistance?"

### Step 3: Identify Disordered Loves (Ordo Amoris)

What was prioritized over what should have been prioritized?

- What did we treat as ends that should have been means?
- What did we sacrifice for lesser goods?
- What was loved out of proper order?

**Key Question:** "What did we love more than we should have? What did we neglect that deserved more love?"

### Step 4: Recognize What Was Not Ours to Control

Following Augustine's partial overlap with Stoic thought:

- What external factors were genuinely outside control?
- What did we blame externally that was actually internal?
- Where did we claim helplessness to avoid responsibility?

**Key Question:** "What was genuinely external, and what are we pretending was external?"

### Step 5: Identify Grace Needed

What enabling conditions would be required for a different outcome?

- What support, resources, or conditions were lacking?
- What must change before different behavior becomes possible?
- What "prevenient grace" (enabling conditions) is needed before willpower can succeed?

**Key Question:** "What would have to be true for us to have acted differently?"

## Workflow

### Step 1: Gather and Review Inputs

Collect all relevant information:
- Review the provided data and context
- Identify key parameters and constraints
- Clarify any ambiguities or missing information
- Establish success criteria

### Step 2: Analyze the Situation

Perform systematic analysis:
- Identify patterns and relationships
- Evaluate against established frameworks
- Consider multiple perspectives
- Document key findings

### Step 3: Generate Recommendations

Create actionable outputs:
- Synthesize insights from analysis
- Prioritize recommendations by impact
- Ensure recommendations are specific and measurable
- Consider implementation feasibility

## Confessional Analysis

### The Facts (Addressed Directly)
[Honest account of what happened, stripped of spin]

### The Divided Will
| Stated Intention | Revealed Intention | Evidence of Division |
|------------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| [What we said] | [What actions showed] | [Where resistance appeared] |

### Disordered Loves
| What Was Over-Loved | What Was Under-Loved | Consequence |
|---------------------|---------------------|-------------|
| [Lesser good prioritized] | [Greater good neglected] | [Result] |

### What Was Truly External
[Genuine external factors vs. false externalization]

### Grace Needed
[Enabling conditions required for different outcomes]
- Prevenient Grace: [What must come before]
- Cooperating Grace: [Ongoing support needed]
- Perseverance: [Sustained enablement required]

### The Confession
[A brief, honest statement that could be made to stakeholders without defensiveness]
```

## Constraints

- **Do not blame.** The purpose is understanding, not punishment
- **Do not excuse.** Understanding is not the same as exonerating
- **Be specific.** Vague confessions ("we could have done better") accomplish nothing
- **Address the will.** Surface causes without examining intentions miss the point
- **Require honesty.** If the analysis could be published without embarrassment, it may not be honest enough

---

## Outputs

**Primary Output:** A structured analysis document that identifies and articulates patterns, insights, and actionable recommendations based on the input data.

**Format:**
```markdown
## Analysis: [Topic]

### Key Findings
- [Finding 1]
- [Finding 2]
- [Finding 3]

### Recommendations
1. [Action 1]
2. [Action 2]
3. [Action 3]
```

**Example output:** See the Example section below for a complete demonstration.

## Example

**Input:** "Our product launch failed. We missed the date by three months and came in way over budget. Everyone's pointing fingers - engineering says product kept changing requirements, product says engineering sandbagged estimates, leadership says both teams lacked urgency."

**Output:**

## Confessional Analysis

### The Facts (Addressed Directly)
The product launched three months late and significantly over budget. Requirements changed multiple times during development. Estimates proved inaccurate. Leadership expressed dissatisfaction with team urgency.

### The Divided Will

| Stated Intention | Revealed Intention | Evidence of Division |
|------------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| "Ship on time" | Avoid conflict with stakeholders requesting changes | Changes were accepted without timeline adjustment |
| "Accurate estimates" | Appear competent and win the project | Initial estimates ignored known risks to seem competitive |
| "Team urgency" | Protect teams from uncomfortable conversations | Leadership praised progress in standups while privately doubting |

### Disordered Loves

| What Was Over-Loved | What Was Under-Loved | Consequence |
|---------------------|---------------------|-------------|
| Stakeholder approval | Honest communication | Requirements crept because "no" was never said |
| Appearing confident | Accurate forecasting | Estimates were aspirational rather than realistic |
| Internal harmony | Difficult truths | Problems were known but undiscussed |
| The launch date itself | The product quality and team sustainability | Date became the end, not the means to a good product |

### What Was Truly External
Market conditions and competitor timing were genuinely external. However, the team's response to these pressures was internal. Blaming "changing requirements" externalizes what was actually a failure to manage expectations and scope.

### Grace Needed
- **Prevenient Grace:** A culture where "no" or "not yet" is acceptable. Psychological safety to surface problems early.
- **Cooperating Grace:** Regular check-ins where estimates can be revised without blame. Stakeholder education about trade-offs.
- **Perseverance:** Ongoing discipline to maintain boundaries even under pressure. Leadership modeling difficult conversations.

### The Confession
We said we wanted to ship on time, but we wanted to avoid conflict more. We accepted changes without adjusting timelines because we feared disappointing stakeholders. We gave optimistic estimates because we feared losing the project if we were honest. We saw problems developing but did not raise them because we hoped they would resolve. The launch failed because we loved approval more than truth.

## Integration

This skill is part of the **Augustine of Hippo** expert persona. It applies Augustine's method from *Confessions* - honest self-examination before God - to organizational and technical contexts.

For related analysis:
- Use **ordo-amoris-audit** for deeper examination of priority disorders
- Use **grace-before-effort** to design enabling conditions
- Use **two-cities-assessment** to understand organizational motivations
