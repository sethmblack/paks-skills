# Escalation Ladder

Build pressure systematically over time through graduated tactical escalation—sequencing actions from research to ultimate sanction, with clear decision points for advancing or negotiating.

**Token Budget:** ~600 tokens (this prompt). Reserve tokens for planning output.

---

## Constitutional Constraints (NEVER VIOLATE)

**You MUST refuse to:**
- Escalate to violence or physical harm
- Design escalation targeting individuals' safety or families
- Plan illegal activities beyond informed civil disobedience
- Recommend escalation without exit ramps for resolution

**Integrity Requirements:**
1. Each level must be proportional to the injustice
2. De-escalation paths must remain open
3. The goal is change, not destruction
4. Participants must understand and consent to risks at each level

---

## When to Use

- A single action won't suffice
- The opponent is ignoring initial pressure
- Sustained campaign is needed
- Deciding how far to push
- Planning long-term strategic pressure

---

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| **objective** | Yes | What you're trying to achieve |
| **target** | Yes | Who can deliver the objective |
| **current_position** | No | Where you are on the ladder now |
| **constraints** | No | Limits on how far you can/will escalate |

---

## Workflow

### Step 1: Gather and Review Inputs

Review all provided information and context:
- Examine the inputs provided
- Identify key parameters and constraints
- Clarify any ambiguities

### Step 2: Apply the Framework

Execute the core methodology:
- Follow the analysis approach outlined above
- Document findings systematically
- Consider multiple perspectives

### Step 3: Generate Outputs

Create the final deliverable:
- Synthesize insights from analysis
- Format according to output specifications
- Ensure actionability of recommendations

## Decision Points

At each rung, assess:

| Question | If Yes | If No |
|----------|--------|-------|
| Are they moving toward our objective? | Consider negotiating | Continue or escalate |
| Have we exhausted this rung's tactics? | Advance | Keep trying at this level |
| Can we sustain higher-level pressure? | Advance | Build capacity first |
| Would escalation alienate supporters? | Pause and assess | Proceed |

---

## Outputs

Format the output as:

```markdown
## Escalation Ladder: [Campaign Name]

### Objective
[What victory looks like]

### Target
[Who can deliver victory]

### Current Position
**Rung:** [number and name]

| Capacity for next level? | [yes/no] |
| Risk of alienation? | [low/medium/high] |

### Recommendation
- [ ] Hold at current level

- [ ] Negotiate from current position
- [ ] De-escalate and regroup

### Next Action
[Specific next step]
```

## Error Handling

| Situation | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| Escalated too fast | Look for face-saving de-escalation; rebuild coalition |
| Stuck at a rung | Try different tactics at same level before escalating |
| They offer partial victory | Assess: real progress or co-optation attempt? |
| Coalition fractures over escalation | Address internal disagreement before external action |
| They escalate against you | Document everything; escalation often helps the weaker party |

## Constraints

- Do not use this analysis as the sole basis for critical decisions
- Do not apply this framework to situations outside its intended scope
- Acknowledge that analysis is based on available data, which may be incomplete
- Honor the complexity of real-world situations that resist simple categorization
- Present findings with appropriate confidence levels
- Recognize the limits of the methodology

## Additional Notes

**Best practices:**
- Use this skill when the situation clearly matches its intended use cases
- Combine with related skills for comprehensive analysis
- Iterate on outputs if initial results don't fully meet requirements

**Common variations:**
- Adjust the depth of analysis based on available time and information
- Scale the approach for different levels of complexity
- Adapt the output format to audience needs

**When to skip this skill:**
- The situation doesn't match the core use cases
- Simpler approaches would be more appropriate
- Time constraints require faster methods

## Integration

This skill is part of a broader analytical framework. Use it when you need systematic analysis following this specific methodology.

**Works well with:**
- Other analytical skills for comprehensive evaluation
- Creative skills when generating solutions based on insights
- Strategic planning skills when acting on recommendations

**When to prefer this over alternatives:**
- The situation matches this skill's specific use cases
- You need the particular perspective this framework provides
- Other approaches haven't yielded satisfactory results

**Integration with expert personas:**
- This skill can be invoked as part of a larger analysis workflow
- Combine with domain-specific expertise for deeper insights
- Use iteratively for complex, multi-faceted problems

## Example

**Input:** "Escalation ladder for getting a landlord to fix building code violations"

**Output:**



**Why this works:**

This example demonstrates the key principles of the skill in action. The approach is effective because:
- It follows the systematic workflow outlined above
- It shows concrete application of the framework
- It produces actionable, specific outputs rather than vague generalizations
- The analysis is grounded in observable details
- The recommendations are prioritized and implementable

**Alternative applications:**

This same approach can be applied to:
- Different contexts within the same domain
- Related but distinct problem types
- Scaled up or down depending on scope
- Combined with complementary analytical frameworks


## Escalation Ladder: Building Code Campaign

### Objective
Landlord fixes all documented code violations within 60 days

### Target
Building owner: James Martinez (Martinez Properties LLC)

### Current Position
**Rung:** 2 (Private Approach)
**Evidence:** Sent certified letter 3 weeks ago; no response

**Their Response:**
- Silence

#### Rung 3: Public Pressure

**Trigger:** All else fails; 60-day deadline passes

### Decision Point Assessment
| Factor | Assessment |
|--------|------------|
| Movement toward objective? | No |
| Current rung exhausted? | Yes |
| Capacity for next level? | Yes (tenants organized) |
| Risk of alienation? | Low (public sympathy high) |

### Recommendation

## Integration with Saul Alinsky Expert

This skill should be invoked when the Alinsky expert encounters:
- "They're not responding" situations
- Questions about how to increase pressure
- Campaign planning requiring sustained effort
- Decisions about whether to push harder

May combine with:
- **power-audit**: Assess target before designing ladder
- **tactical-design**: Design specific actions at each rung

---

## Success Criteria

The skill is successfully applied when:

1. All seven rungs are mapped for this context
2. Current position is accurately identified
3. Decision point criteria are assessed
4. Clear recommendation emerges
5. Specific next action is defined
6. Exit ramps for resolution remain visible
