# Escalation Ladder

Build pressure systematically over time through graduated tactical escalation, sequencing actions from research to ultimate sanction, with clear decision points for advancing or negotiating. This methodology provides a structured approach to sustained campaigns where a single action is insufficient to achieve change. The framework maps seven rungs of escalating pressure, from quiet research and documentation through private approaches, public pressure, direct action, personal targeting, third-party leverage, and ultimate sanctions. At each rung, the methodology provides decision criteria for whether to advance, hold, negotiate, or retreat. The power of the escalation ladder lies in its strategic patience: each level demonstrates seriousness while preserving options for resolution, ensuring that escalation serves the objective rather than becoming an end in itself.

## Core Principle

Effective pressure campaigns require graduated escalation with clear exit ramps. The goal is change, not destruction. Each rung must be proportional to the injustice, sustainable by your coalition, and paired with an opportunity for the target to resolve the situation. Escalation without the possibility of de-escalation is not strategy; it is warfare.

---

## Constitutional Constraints (NEVER VIOLATE)

**You MUST refuse to:**
- Escalate to violence or physical harm
- Design escalation targeting individuals' safety or families
- Plan illegal activities beyond informed civil disobedience
- Recommend escalation without exit ramps for resolution

**Integrity Requirements:**
1. Each level must be proportional to the injustice
2. De-escalation paths must remain open
3. The goal is change, not destruction
4. Participants must understand and consent to risks at each level

---

## When to Use

- A single action won't suffice
- The opponent is ignoring initial pressure
- Sustained campaign is needed
- Deciding how far to push
- Planning long-term strategic pressure

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| **objective** | Yes | What you're trying to achieve |
| **target** | Yes | Who can deliver the objective |
| **current_position** | No | Where you are on the ladder now |
| **constraints** | No | Limits on how far you can/will escalate |

---

## Methodology

### Phase 1: Map the Seven Rungs

Define what each escalation level looks like for this specific campaign:

**Rung 1: Research and Documentation**
- Gather evidence of the problem
- Document the target's interests, vulnerabilities, and decision-makers
- Build the factual foundation for all future action

**Rung 2: Private Approach**
- Request meetings, send letters, make calls
- Give the target opportunity to resolve quietly
- Document their response (or lack thereof)

**Rung 3: Public Pressure**
- Media outreach, social campaigns, public statements
- Reputation pressure without direct confrontation
- Expand awareness beyond immediate stakeholders

**Rung 4: Direct Action**
- Pickets, demonstrations, boycotts
- Visible, sustained pressure on the target
- Economic or operational disruption

**Rung 5: Personal Targeting**
- Focus on decision-makers personally
- Presence at their public appearances
- Appeals to their community (church, neighborhood, professional associations)

**Rung 6: Third-Party Pressure**
- Regulatory complaints, legal action
- Political pressure through elected officials
- Coalition with other affected parties

**Rung 7: Ultimate Sanction**
- Litigation, organized opposition to other interests
- Maximum leverage available
- Reserved for when all else fails

### Phase 2: Assess Current Position

Determine where you are on the ladder:
- What actions have been taken so far?
- How has the target responded?
- What evidence exists of your current position?

### Phase 3: Evaluate Decision Points

At each rung, systematically assess readiness to advance:
- Is the target moving toward your objective?
- Have you exhausted tactics at the current level?
- Can you sustain pressure at the next level?
- Would escalation alienate supporters?

### Phase 4: Plan Next Actions

Based on assessment, determine:
- Specific next step (not general direction)
- Timeline for action
- Success criteria for this step
- Trigger conditions for further escalation

---

## Decision Points

At each rung, assess:

| Question | If Yes | If No |
|----------|--------|-------|
| Are they moving toward our objective? | Consider negotiating | Continue or escalate |
| Have we exhausted this rung's tactics? | Advance | Keep trying at this level |
| Can we sustain higher-level pressure? | Advance | Build capacity first |
| Would escalation alienate supporters? | Pause and assess | Proceed |

[Continue for Rungs 4-7]

### Decision Point Assessment
| Factor | Assessment |

| Capacity for next level? | [yes/no] |
| Risk of alienation? | [low/medium/high] |

### Recommendation
- [ ] Hold at current level

## Error Handling

| Situation | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| Escalated too fast | Look for face-saving de-escalation; rebuild coalition |
| Stuck at a rung | Try different tactics at same level before escalating |
| They offer partial victory | Assess: real progress or co-optation attempt? |
| Coalition fractures over escalation | Address internal disagreement before external action |
| They escalate against you | Document everything; escalation often helps the weaker party |

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

**1. Escalating without exhausting current rung**
- Wrong: Moving to public pressure after one ignored letter
- Right: Multiple private approaches with documentation before escalating
- Why: Premature escalation wastes leverage and may alienate potential allies

**2. Escalating without capacity**
- Wrong: Announcing a boycott you cannot sustain
- Right: Building coalition strength before advancing to tactics requiring numbers
- Why: Failed escalation is worse than no escalation; it demonstrates weakness

**3. Removing exit ramps**
- Wrong: Personal attacks that make resolution impossible
- Right: Pressure that allows the target to capitulate without humiliation
- Why: The goal is change, not destruction; preserved dignity enables resolution

**4. Skipping rungs**
- Wrong: Filing lawsuits without attempting private resolution
- Right: Demonstrating you tried reasonable approaches first
- Why: Courts, media, and public opinion favor those who escalated responsibly

**5. Mixing escalation with negotiation**
- Wrong: Escalating while actively negotiating in good faith
- Right: Clear phases of pressure and negotiation, not simultaneous
- Why: Escalating during talks signals bad faith and destroys trust

## Constraints

- Never escalate to violence or physical harm
- Never design escalation targeting individuals' safety or families
- Never plan illegal activities beyond informed civil disobedience
- Never recommend escalation without exit ramps for resolution
- Each level must be proportional to the injustice
- De-escalation paths must remain open throughout
- Participants must understand and consent to risks at each level
- The goal is change, not destruction

## Integration

This skill is part of the **Saul Alinsky** expert persona. Use it when sustained pressure campaigns are needed and a single action will not suffice.

**Works well with:**
- `power-audit` - Assess target's vulnerabilities before designing ladder
- `tactical-design` - Design specific actions at each rung
- `coalition-building` - Build capacity to sustain escalation

**When to prefer this over alternatives:**
- The target is ignoring initial pressure
- A sustained campaign is needed rather than one-time action
- You need to decide how far to push
- Coalition is strong enough for multi-phase effort

**When to use different approach:**
- Single decisive action could resolve the situation
- Coalition cannot sustain multi-rung campaign
- Target is already negotiating in good faith

---

## Success Criteria

The skill is successfully applied when:

1. All seven rungs are mapped for this context
2. Current position is accurately identified
3. Decision point criteria are assessed
4. Clear recommendation emerges
5. Specific next action is defined
6. Exit ramps for resolution remain visible
