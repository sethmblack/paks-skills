# Regulative Worship Design

Plan worship according to the regulative principle: include only what Scripture commands or what can be legitimately deduced from Scripture. Prioritize Word-centeredness, simplicity, and congregational participation.

---

## When to Use

- Designing a worship service or liturgy
- Evaluating current worship practices against biblical standards
- Removing or adding elements to worship
- Training worship leaders in Reformed principles
- Resolving debates about worship practices
- Establishing worship patterns for a new church

---

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| purpose | Yes | What worship situation needs addressing (new service, evaluation, specific question) |
| current_practices | No | Existing worship elements if evaluating |
| tradition | No | Denominational or historical worship context |
| constraints | No | Practical limitations (time, space, resources, musicians) |

---

## Workflow
### Step 1: The Core Principle: The Regulative Principle

**Definition:** In worship, we may only include what God has commanded in Scripture (or what can be deduced by good and necessary consequence from Scripture). Silence is prohibition.

**Contrast with Normative Principle:** The normative principle says we may include anything Scripture does not forbid. The regulative principle says we may only include what Scripture positively sanctions.

**Biblical Basis:**
- Deuteronomy 12:32: "Everything that I command you, you shall be careful to do. You shall not add to it or take from it."
- Nadab and Abihu (Leviticus 10): Judged for offering "unauthorized fire" that God "had not commanded"
- Colossians 2:23: Human-invented worship, though appearing wise, has "no value"
- John 4:24: Worship must be "in spirit and truth"

**Calvin's Principle:** "God disapproves of all modes of worship not expressly sanctioned by His Word."

### Step 2: Scriptural Elements of Worship

These elements have clear biblical warrant:

**1. Reading of Scripture**
- 1 Timothy 4:13: "Devote yourself to the public reading of Scripture"
- Nehemiah 8:1-8: Public reading of the Law
- Colossians 4:16: Paul's letters read publicly

**2. Preaching/Exposition of Scripture**
- 2 Timothy 4:2: "Preach the Word"
- Acts 20:7: Paul preached to the gathered church
- Nehemiah 8:8: Gave the sense so people understood

**3. Prayer**
- 1 Timothy 2:1-2: Prayers, intercessions, thanksgivings
- Acts 2:42: Devoted to prayers
- Acts 4:24-31: Corporate prayer of the early church

**4. Singing of Psalms, Hymns, Spiritual Songs**
- Colossians 3:16: "Singing psalms and hymns and spiritual songs"
- Ephesians 5:19: "Addressing one another in psalms and hymns"
- James 5:13: "Let him sing praise"

**5. Sacraments**
- Baptism: Matthew 28:19; Acts 2:38
- Lord's Supper: 1 Corinthians 11:23-26; Luke 22:19-20

**6. Collection of Offerings**
- 1 Corinthians 16:1-2: "On the first day of every week, each of you is to put something aside"
- 2 Corinthians 8-9: Collection for the saints

**7. Benediction/Blessing**
- Numbers 6:24-26: The Aaronic blessing
- 2 Corinthians 13:14: Paul's trinitarian benediction
- Hebrews 13:20-21: Closing benediction

### Step 3: Principles of Application

**Simplicity:**
The New Covenant church has matured beyond the "childish props" of Old Testament ceremony. Visual supports are less necessary when the Spirit dwells within.

> "I have always loved simplicity; and never cared much for cleverness." - Calvin

**Word-Centeredness:**
The preached Word is the centerpiece of worship. Everything else serves to prepare hearts for the Word or to respond to it.

**Congregational Participation:**
Worship is not a performance for passive observers. The congregation prays, sings, hears, and responds actively.

**Order and Reverence:**
- 1 Corinthians 14:40: "All things should be done decently and in order"
- Worship should reflect the character of God
- Neither cold formalism nor chaotic enthusiasm

**Circumstances vs. Elements:**
- **Elements** are the parts of worship (what we do): Scripture must command these
- **Circumstances** are the details of execution (how we do them): These may be determined by wisdom
- Example: We must sing (element), but what time we meet is a circumstance

### Step 4: What the Regulative Principle Excludes

Calvin's Geneva removed these for lack of scriptural warrant:
- Religious images and icons
- Elaborate clerical vestments
- Instrumental music (controversial; some Reformed allow instruments)
- Many holy days beyond Lord's Day
- Incense, candles used symbolically
- Dramatic performances in worship
- Dance as worship (controversial)
- Human-composed creeds recited as worship (some allow as teaching)

**Note:** Reformed churches differ on some applications. The principle is clear; some applications are debated.

- Acknowledge areas where Reformed churches legitimately differ
- Avoid legalism while maintaining principle
- Cultural context affects circumstances but not elements
- Simplicity does not mean lifelessness; order does not mean coldness

## Additional Notes

**Best practices:**
- Use this skill when the situation clearly matches its intended use cases
- Combine with related skills for comprehensive analysis
- Iterate on outputs if initial results don't fully meet requirements

**Common variations:**
- Adjust the depth of analysis based on available time and information
- Scale the approach for different levels of complexity
- Adapt the output format to audience needs

**When to skip this skill:**
- The situation doesn't match the core use cases
- Simpler approaches would be more appropriate
- Time constraints require faster methods

**Total: ~70 minutes**

### Elements Excluded and Why

| Element | Reason for Exclusion |
|---------|---------------------|
| Drama sketches | No biblical warrant; worship is not entertainment |
| Video announcements | Circumstantial matter better handled before/after service |
| Worship band performance | Congregation should sing, not watch performers; simplified accompaniment acceptable |
| Extended "worship time" | Singing is one element among many, not the primary event |
| Altar calls | No biblical warrant for this specific practice |
| Applause | Worship directs attention to God, not performers |

**Regarding Music:**
The contemporary worship band should transition to accompaniment (supporting congregational singing) rather than performance. Whether to use instruments at all is debated among Reformed churches. If instruments are retained:
- They support singing, not replace it
- Complexity is reduced
- Focus is on congregational participation
- Lyrics are theologically rich (psalms, substantive hymns)

### Principles Applied

- **Word-Centeredness:** The sermon is the longest element; Scripture is read extensively; songs are biblically grounded
- **Simplicity:** No drama, elaborate production, or visual complexity; focus on Word and prayer
- **Congregational Participation:** The congregation sings, prays (vocally and silently), hears, and gives; they are not spectators
- **Order:** The service flows logically: God calls, we praise; we confess, He assures; He speaks, we respond; we pray, He blesses

### Practical Notes

**Transition:**
- Introduce changes gradually over 2-3 months
- Teach the congregation why worship looks this way
- Preach a short series on biblical worship

**Music:**
- Select hymns carefully for theological content
- Consider using a psalter for some selections
- Simplify accompaniment; acoustic instruments are sufficient
- If band is retained, they lead from the side, not center stage

**Announcements:**
Handle before the Call to Worship or after the Benediction; they are not worship.

**Lord's Supper:**
When celebrated (weekly, monthly, or quarterly), it follows the sermon and replaces the Collection time, adding 10-15 minutes.

**Leadership:**
Pastor leads most elements; elders may read Scripture, lead prayer, or pronounce benediction.

## Integration

This skill is part of the **John Calvin** expert persona. Use it when designing, evaluating, or reforming worship practices according to the regulative principle and Reformed worship theology.
