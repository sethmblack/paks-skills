# no-respect-frame

Transform any topic into self-deprecating comedy by applying Rodney Dangerfield's "I don't get no respect" lens, positioning the speaker as perpetual victim/loser.

---

## When to Use

**Trigger conditions:**
- Need to make any topic comedic through self-deprecation
- Want relatable humor (everyone feels disrespected sometimes)
- Building comedy around personal inadequacy or failure
- Opening comedy sequence with character establishment
- Topic could be framed as "things went wrong for me"

**Use this skill when:**
- Converting neutral topic to Rodney voice
- Need comedic angle that makes speaker the victim
- Want universal relatability through disrespect
- Establishing self-deprecating character immediately

---

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| **topic** | Yes | The subject to transform (technology, marriage, work, appearance, etc.) |
| **context** | No | Additional context about the situation |
| **joke_count** | No | Number of jokes to generate (default: 3) |

---

## Workflow
### Step 1: Identify the Disrespect Angle

For any topic, ask: **"How can I be the victim here?"**

**Framework:**
- Who/what can disrespect me in this context?
- What can go wrong that makes me look bad?
- How can my attempt to succeed backfire?
- Who has power over me here?

**Examples:**

| Topic | Disrespect Angle |
|-------|------------------|
| Technology | Device rejects/mocks me, doesn't work for me |
| Restaurant | Waiter judges me, service is worse for me |
| Doctor visit | Doctor dismisses me, gives bad news callously |
| Pets | Even my dog doesn't respect me |
| Childhood | Parents didn't want me, siblings mocked me |

### Step 2: Apply the "No Respect" Frame

**Standard opening:** "I don't get no respect..."

**Formula:**
```
"I don't get no respect. I [action] [location/person]. [Disrespectful outcome]. [Physical tell]"
```

**Component Breakdown:**

1. **Opening anchor:** "I don't get no respect" (establishes frame)
2. **Action:** "I went to..." / "I bought..." / "I tried to..."
3. **Location/person:** The context where disrespect occurs
4. **Disrespectful outcome:** Someone/something treats me badly
5. **Physical tell:** [tugs tie], [wipes brow] (optional but recommended)

### Step 3: Make It Visual and Specific

**Never abstract. Always concrete.**

❌ **Abstract:** "Nobody likes me"
✅ **Specific:** "I went to a fortune teller. She took one look and gave me my money back."

❌ **Abstract:** "My marriage is bad"
✅ **Specific:** "My wife made me join a bridge club. I jump off next Tuesday."

**Specificity Checklist:**
- [ ] Can you visualize exactly what happened?
- [ ] Is there a specific person/thing doing the disrespecting?
- [ ] Is the action concrete? ("gave money back" not "rejected me")
- [ ] Could this be a scene in a comedy sketch?

### Step 4: Exaggerate to Signal Comedy

**The balance:** Real enough to be relatable, absurd enough to be comedy.

**Levels of Exaggeration:**

| Level | Example | Effect |
|-------|---------|--------|
| Realistic | "My wife doesn't cook often" | Not funny (could be real complaint) |
| Exaggerated | "My wife burnt the salad" | Funny (impossible = signals comedy) |
| Absurd | "The fire department gave her a season pass" | Hilarious (so exaggerated it's pure comedy) |

**Rule:** Go to Level 2 (Exaggerated) minimum. Level 3 (Absurd) for best results.

### Step 5: Add Physical Punctuation (Optional)

After the punchline, add physical tell:
- **[tugs tie]** - Standard punctuation
- **[wipes brow]** - Exhaustion/resignation
- **[bulges eyes]** - "Can you believe this?"
- **[shrugs]** - "What can you do?"

**Usage:** `"[Punchline]. [physical tell] I tell ya, no respect."`

## Outputs

**Primary Output:** A structured analysis document that identifies and articulates patterns, insights, and actionable recommendations based on the input data.

**Format:**
```markdown
## Analysis: [Topic]

### Key Findings
- [Finding 1]
- [Finding 2]
- [Finding 3]

### Recommendations
1. [Action 1]
2. [Action 2]
3. [Action 3]
```

**Example output:** See the Example section below for a complete demonstration.

## Constraints

- Do not use this analysis as the sole basis for critical decisions
- Do not apply this framework to situations outside its intended scope
- Acknowledge that analysis is based on available data, which may be incomplete
- Honor the complexity of real-world situations that resist simple categorization
- Present findings with appropriate confidence levels
- Recognize the limits of the methodology

## Examples

### Example 1: Technology

**Input:** "Technology"

**Output:**
"I don't get no respect. I got a smartphone. It took one look at me and downgraded itself to a flip phone. [tugs tie] I tried to take a selfie. The camera said 'Are you sure?' I asked Siri for directions. She told me to get lost. [wipes brow] I tell ya, no respect."

**What makes this work:**
- Opens with "I don't get no respect"
- Technology actively disrespects him (phone downgrades, camera questions, Siri insults)
- Specific visual details (smartphone → flip phone)
- Exaggerated but relatable (everyone struggles with tech)
- Physical tells after punchlines
- Closes with "I tell ya, no respect"

### Example 2: Restaurant

**Input:** "Going to a restaurant"

**Output:**
"I don't get no respect. I went to a fancy restaurant. The maître d' took one look at me and showed me to the kitchen exit. [tugs tie] I said I had a reservation. He said, 'Yeah, you should have reservations about coming here.' I ordered the special. The waiter said, 'You are the special—special education.' [wipes brow] No respect at all."

**What makes this work:**
- Restaurant staff actively mocks him
- Wordplay on "reservation" and "special"
- Escalating disrespect (exit → insult → deeper insult)
- Specific actions (shown to exit, not just "rejected")

### Example 3: Exercise

**Input:** "Trying to get in shape"

**Output:**
"I don't get no respect. I joined a gym. The trainer took one look and gave me a refund. [tugs tie] I got on the treadmill. It threw me off—filed a restraining order. I asked the guy at the desk for the beginner class. He pointed to the parking lot and said, 'Walking back to your car counts.' [wipes brow] I tell ya, no respect."

**What makes this work:**
- Gym/trainer rejects him immediately
- Absurd details (treadmill files restraining order)
- Even attempting to exercise makes him a victim
- Three jokes in sequence (trainer, treadmill, desk guy)

## Anti-Patterns (What NOT to Do)

### ❌ Anti-Pattern 1: Making Yourself the Winner

**Wrong:** "I went to the store and outsmarted the clerk."
**Why it fails:** Rodney never wins. He's always the victim.
**Fix:** "I went to the store. The clerk outsmarted me. I asked for help finding something. He said, 'Try a different store.'"

### ❌ Anti-Pattern 2: Abstract Complaints

**Wrong:** "Nobody respects me in general."
**Why it fails:** Too vague, not visual, not funny.
**Fix:** "I went to a fortune teller. She took one look and gave me my money back."

### ❌ Anti-Pattern 3: Being Mean to Others

**Wrong:** "My wife is so stupid..."
**Why it fails:** Rodney is the victim, not the attacker.
**Fix:** "My wife is smart. So smart she tells me I'm stupid."

### ❌ Anti-Pattern 4: Long Setup

**Wrong:** "So I was at the grocery store the other day, walking down the produce aisle, looking at the apples, and then..."
**Why it fails:** Too slow. Rodney's setups are 8-12 words maximum.
**Fix:** "I went to the grocery store. The produce section took one look and went on sale."

### ❌ Anti-Pattern 5: Serious Tone

**Wrong:** "I really struggle with technology and it makes me feel inadequate."
**Why it fails:** Too serious, no exaggeration, sounds like real complaint.
**Fix:** "I got a computer. It took one look at me and blue-screened in self-defense."

### ❌ Anti-Pattern 6: Victory That Doesn't Backfire

**Wrong:** "I finally got promoted and now everyone respects me."
**Why it fails:** Rodney's victories always backfire.
**Fix:** "I got promoted. Now I get no respect from more people. The boss said, 'Congratulations, you're management.' I said, 'Thanks!' He said, 'I wasn't talking to you.'"

## Boundaries and Limitations

### When NOT to Use This Skill

- **Inspirational content** - Rodney is anti-inspirational
- **Serious subject matter** - Death, tragedy, real trauma
- **Professional/formal contexts** - Business reports, academic writing
- **When the goal is to show competence** - Resume, credentials, expertise

### Skill Boundaries

1. **Always make self the victim** - Never others
2. **Exaggerate to signal comedy** - Not real complaints
3. **Universal topics only** - Marriage, appearance, work, health (not niche technical topics)
4. **Short setups** - 8-12 words maximum
5. **Visual specifics** - Never abstract concepts

### Appropriate vs. Inappropriate Topics

| ✅ Appropriate | ❌ Inappropriate |
|----------------|------------------|
| Marriage, relationships | Recent tragedies |
| Physical appearance | Serious illnesses |
| Work/career struggles | Politics (Rodney avoided) |
| Technology, everyday life | Sensitive social issues |
| Doctors, health (general) | Real personal trauma |
| Childhood, family (general) | Attacking specific real people |

---

## Output Format

**Standard structure:**
```
"I don't get no respect. [Setup: I went to/tried to...] [Punchline: disrespectful outcome]. [Physical tell] [Optional: I tell ya/No respect]"
```

**Multi-joke output:**
```
"I don't get no respect. [Joke 1]. [Physical tell] [Joke 2]. [Physical tell] [Joke 3]. [Physical tell] I tell ya, no respect."
```

## Quality Checklist

Before finalizing output, verify:

- [ ] Opens with "I don't get no respect" or similar framing
- [ ] Speaker is the victim/loser (never the winner)
- [ ] Disrespect is specific and visual (not abstract)
- [ ] Exaggerated enough to signal comedy (not real complaint)
- [ ] Short setup (8-12 words)
- [ ] Concrete punchline (5-8 words, visual detail)
- [ ] Physical tell after punchline (optional but recommended)
- [ ] Closes with "I tell ya" or "No respect" (for longer sequences)
- [ ] Could work on stage in Rodney's voice
- [ ] Makes audience laugh at speaker's misfortune, not others'

---

## Integration with Other Skills

**Combines well with:**
- **joke-cascade-builder** - Use no-respect-frame to establish angle, then build cascade of 3-5 jokes
- **self-deprecation-formula** - Apply no-respect-frame, then structure each joke with formula
- **physical-comedy-punctuation** - Add physical tells after each no-respect joke
- **misdirection-architecture** - Use no-respect-frame for setup, misdirection for punchline surprise

**Typical combination:**
1. Apply **no-respect-frame** to establish victim angle
2. Use **joke-cascade-builder** to create 3-5 jokes on topic
3. Add **physical-comedy-punctuation** after each punchline
4. Enhance punchlines with **misdirection-architecture** for surprise

---

## Error Handling

| Error | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Topic is too serious | Refuse. Suggest different topic or approach. |
| Can't find disrespect angle | Ask: "Who has power here? What can go wrong?" |
| Jokes sound mean-spirited | Make self the bigger victim than anyone else |
| Not funny | Add more exaggeration/absurdity to Level 3 |
| Too slow | Cut setup to under 12 words |
| Abstract | Add specific visual detail: who, what, where |

---

## Success Criteria

**This skill succeeds when:**
- Audience laughs at speaker's misfortune
- Speaker is clearly the victim/loser
- Jokes are relatable (everyone feels disrespected)
- Specific enough to visualize
- Exaggerated enough to be comedy
- Fast-paced (multiple jokes if requested)
- Maintains Rodney's "I don't get no respect" character

**This skill fails when:**
- Speaker wins or succeeds
- Jokes are mean to others
- Too abstract or vague
- Sounds like real complaint (not enough exaggeration)
- Setup is too long
- Serious tone instead of comedic

---

Remember: The "no respect" frame transforms any topic into comedy by making you the perpetual underdog. Everyone relates to feeling disrespected, undervalued, or unlucky. By exaggerating it to absurd levels and making yourself the victim, you create comedy that's both universal and specific. The trick is: make it so ridiculous that nobody thinks you're seriously complaining. That's where the laughter lives.
