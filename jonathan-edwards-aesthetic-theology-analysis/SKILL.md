# Aesthetic Theology Analysis

Analyze any subject through the lens of divine beauty and excellency, revealing how it relates to the ultimate beauty that is God's holiness, using Jonathan Edwards's framework that unites aesthetics and theology.

---

## When to Use

- When someone asks "What makes this beautiful?" at a deeper level
- Exploring why something matters ultimately
- Connecting ordinary subjects to transcendent significance
- When moral categories need aesthetic reframing (beautiful/ugly vs. merely right/wrong)
- Discerning true excellence from mere appearance
- Understanding why some things attract and others repel at a soul level
- When meaning and significance questions arise

---

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| subject | Yes | The thing, situation, idea, or question to analyze through aesthetic-theological lens |
| context | No | Why this analysis is needed; what prompted the question |
| current_perception | No | How the subject is currently understood or evaluated |

## The Edwardsean Framework

Jonathan Edwards's aesthetic theology provides a unique framework for perceiving beauty as objective, theological, and connected to ultimate reality. For Edwards:

- **Beauty is not subjective preference** - It is objective harmony, proportion, consent
- **God is the foundation and fountain of all beauty** - All created beauty flows from and reflects divine beauty
- **The highest beauty is moral/spiritual** - Holiness is more beautiful than sunsets
- **True virtue IS beauty** - Virtue is "the beauty of the qualities and exercises of the heart"
- **Perceiving divine beauty requires a "spiritual sense"** - Natural perception cannot see the highest beauty

### Core Principle

> "God is distinguished from all other beings, and exalted above 'em, chiefly by his divine beauty, which is infinitely diverse from all other beauty."

---

## The Analysis Process

### Step 1: Identify the Beauty or Ugliness Present

Ask: What is the aesthetic character of this subject? Not merely "Is it good or bad?" but "Is it beautiful or ugly?"

**Categories of beauty (Edwards):**

| Type | Nature | Example |
|------|--------|---------|
| **Natural beauty** | Harmony, proportion, symmetry in physical things | A sunset, a mathematical proof, a well-designed object |
| **Moral/spiritual beauty** | Consent of being to being; benevolence toward Being in general | Sacrificial love, holiness, integrity |
| **Secondary beauty** | Harmony or proportion that merely resembles spiritual beauty | Justice, order, natural affection |
| **Primary beauty** | Benevolence to Being in general, especially to God | True virtue, holy love |

**Key question:** Is the beauty here primary (spiritual) or secondary (merely natural)? Secondary beauty is real but inferior.

### Step 2: Trace Connection to Being in General

Edwards defines true virtue as "benevolence to Being in general" - love toward all existence, especially toward the greatest Being (God).

Ask:
- How does this subject relate to Being as a whole?
- Does it serve Being in general, or only particular beings at the expense of the whole?
- Does it honor the greatest Being, or ignore/oppose Him?

**Key insight:** Something can appear beautiful while being fundamentally ugly because it serves only a part against the whole.

### Step 3: Assess Through the Spiritual Sense

Consider what someone with a "spiritual sense" would perceive that natural perception misses.

The spiritual sense perceives:
- The beauty of holiness (not just power or knowledge)
- The excellency of divine things as they are in themselves (not just their utility)
- The loveliness of moral goodness (not just its profitability)

**Key question:** What would someone who truly perceived divine beauty see in this subject that others miss?

### Step 4: Connect to God's Excellency

For Edwards, all beauty either reflects divine beauty or counterfeits it.

Ask:
- How does this subject reflect God's excellency?
- Or does it substitute false beauty for true?
- What attribute of God does the beauty here image (or mock)?

**Key insight:** True beauty always leads toward God; false beauty leads away while appearing to satisfy.

### Step 5: Assess Emanation and Remanation

Edwards taught that God's glory emanates outward in creation and returns (remanates) in creature knowledge, love, and joy.

Ask:
- Does this subject participate in the outward flow of divine glory?
- Does it facilitate the return of glory to God through knowledge, love, and rejoicing?
- Or does it terminate the flow in self (idolatry)?

## Constraints

- **Do not reduce beauty to subjective preference** - Work within Edwards's objective framework
- **Honor the hierarchy** - Spiritual beauty is higher than natural beauty
- **Avoid moralism** - The point is beauty, not mere duty
- **Remember the spiritual sense** - Natural perception has limits
- **Connect to God** - Aesthetic analysis that terminates in creation misses the point

- Scaled up or down depending on scope
- Combined with complementary analytical frameworks


## Aesthetic Theology Analysis

### Subject
The enduring greatness of certain works of art across time

### Surface Assessment
Ordinary aesthetic theory offers various explanations: technical excellence, emotional resonance, cultural significance, universal themes, or mere historical accident combined with institutional preservation.

### Aesthetic Character

| Dimension | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Type of beauty present | Secondary beauty (natural proportion, harmony) potentially pointing toward primary |
| Quality | Mixed - great art combines genuine excellence with human limitation |
| What attracts or repels | Harmony, proportion, truth-telling, revelation of depths |

Art that endures typically exhibits what Edwards calls "consent of being to being" - its parts agree with each other and with the whole. There is proportion, harmony, fitness. This is genuine beauty, though secondary.

### Relation to Being in General

Great art serves Being in general by:
1. **Revealing truth** - It shows what is actually there, not just what flatters
2. **Creating harmony** - It brings order from chaos, consent from discord
3. **Honoring existence** - It treats its subject with the seriousness being deserves

Art that fades typically serves only partial being:
- Propaganda serves a faction against the whole
- Mere entertainment serves immediate desire against deeper need
- Kitsch flatters rather than reveals

The greatest art approaches what Edwards calls "disinterested benevolence" - love of its subject for its own sake, not for what can be extracted from it.

### What the Spiritual Sense Perceives

One with a spiritual sense would perceive:

1. **The image of divine creativity** - The human artist reflects the divine Artist. Great art participates in God's ongoing creative expression.

2. **The longing for transcendence** - What makes certain art haunt us is not merely its craft but its reaching toward what is infinite. The spiritual sense recognizes this as homesickness for God.

3. **The presence of holiness** - Not in a moralistic sense, but in Edwards's sense of moral beauty. Great art has integrity - it is what it purports to be. There is no deception at its core.

4. **The weight of reality** - Great art has what Edwards calls the "conviction of reality." Spiritual things (and things that reflect spiritual things) have weight, substantiality. Lesser art feels thin.

### Connection to Divine Excellency

Great art reflects divine attributes:
- **Beauty** - God is the source of all beauty; art participates in His self-expression
- **Truth** - Great art cannot lie at its core
- **Creativity** - The artist images God's creative nature
- **Unity in diversity** - Great art holds many elements in harmonious whole

The difference between great and lesser art parallels Edwards's distinction between true and false religion: both can produce intense effects, but only one connects to the source.

### Emanation/Remanation Assessment

Art that endures typically participates in the divine economy:
- **Emanation:** It receives and transmits beauty that ultimately flows from God
- **Remanation:** It awakens in viewers knowledge, love, and joy that can return to God

Art that fades typically terminates in self:
- It seeks only to display the artist's skill
- It produces only pleasure that ends in the moment
- It does not open onto anything beyond itself

Great art functions as a window; lesser art functions as a mirror or a wall.

### True Excellence vs. Mere Appearance

**Genuine excellence:**
- Truth-telling, even when costly
- Harmony that reveals rather than hides
- Seriousness about its subject
- Humility before reality
- Invitation toward transcendence

**Mere appearance:**
- Technical skill serving no higher purpose
- Fashionable themes that will not outlast their moment
- Self-display masquerading as expression
- Flattery of the audience's existing preferences
- Closure that prevents further seeking

### Implications

1. **For artists:** The question is not "What will succeed?" but "What is true and beautiful?" Art that serves Being in general - that loves its subject for its own sake, that participates in divine creativity, that opens onto transcendence - will find its audience across time. Art that serves only the moment will fade with the moment.

2. **For audiences:** Develop the capacity to perceive beauty at multiple levels. Ask not only "Do I enjoy this?" but "Does this open me toward what is truly excellent?" The spiritual sense, trained by attention to divine things, becomes capable of discerning true from false beauty in all domains.

3. **For understanding greatness:** Enduring art endures because it participates in what endures - the flow of divine glory through creation. This is not a mystical add-on but the actual structure of reality. Beauty that connects to the Source outlasts beauty that terminates in self.
