# Reformed Church Governance

Design church polity using Presbyterian principles: plurality of qualified elders, distinction of offices by function, representative governance, and proper relationship between church and civil authority.

---

## When to Use

- Establishing a new church or reorganizing an existing one
- Clarifying leadership roles and responsibilities
- Designing decision-making processes for a congregation
- Addressing governance conflicts or confusion
- Training elders, deacons, or other church leaders
- Evaluating whether current polity aligns with biblical principles

---

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| situation | Yes | The church governance question or situation to address |
| church_context | No | Size, denomination, current structure, history |
| specific_issue | No | Particular governance problem to solve |
| constraints | No | Denominational requirements, legal considerations |

## Workflow
### Core Principle

Christ alone is the head of the Church. Human governance structures exist to serve His purposes, maintain order, guard doctrine, and care for souls. No single individual should rule; authority is distributed among qualified leaders who govern together.

As Calvin established in Geneva: the church is governed by **multiple offices working in concert**, each with distinct functions, all accountable to Scripture and to one another.

### The Four Offices

**1. Pastors (Ministers of the Word)**

*Function:*
- Preach and teach the Word of God
- Administer the sacraments (baptism and Lord's Supper)
- Lead public worship
- Exercise discipline with the elders
- Shepherd souls through counseling and care

*Qualifications:* (1 Timothy 3:1-7, Titus 1:5-9)
- Above reproach
- Able to teach
- Not a recent convert
- Well thought of by outsiders
- Character requirements (self-controlled, hospitable, not quarrelsome, etc.)

**2. Teachers (Doctors of the Church)**

*Function:*
- Instruct in sound doctrine
- Guard theological purity
- Train future ministers
- Write and develop theological resources
- Address doctrinal controversies

*Distinction from Pastors:*
- Focus on instruction and theological precision
- May not have pastoral oversight responsibilities
- Often serve in academic or training contexts

**3. Elders (Ruling Elders/Presbyters)**

*Function:*
- Govern the church alongside pastors
- Exercise discipline
- Oversee congregational life
- Visit members and assess spiritual health
- Ensure proper order in worship and conduct

*Key Insight:*
Elders and pastors together form the "session" or "consistory" that governs the church. Pastors are "teaching elders"; ruling elders focus on governance without regular preaching duties.

*Qualifications:* Same as pastors (1 Timothy 3:1-7), though teaching ability may be less emphasized

**4. Deacons**

*Function:*
- Care for the poor and sick
- Administer charitable funds
- Practical service ministry
- Manage physical needs of the congregation
- Free elders and pastors for Word and prayer

*Biblical Basis:* Acts 6:1-7 (appointment of the Seven)

*Qualifications:* 1 Timothy 3:8-13 (dignified, not double-tongued, tested first)

### Governing Structures

**The Session/Consistory:**
- Composed of pastors and ruling elders
- Governs the local congregation
- Exercises church discipline
- Oversees worship, doctrine, and conduct
- Makes major decisions for the congregation

**Plurality Principle:**
- No single individual has unilateral authority
- Decisions made collectively
- Mutual accountability among leaders
- Guard against both tyranny and anarchy

**Representative Governance:**
- Elders represent the congregation
- Authority delegated, not absolute
- Congregation has voice in selecting leaders
- Leaders accountable to God, Scripture, and the body

### Church Discipline

**Purpose:**
- Maintain purity of the church
- Restore the wayward
- Warn others
- Vindicate the honor of Christ

**Process:** (Matthew 18:15-17)

### Step 1: Private confrontation



### Step 2: Confrontation with witnesses



### Step 3: Tell it to the church (session)



### Step 4: Excommunication as last resort



**Posture:**
- Discipline is pastoral care, not punishment
- Goal is always restoration
- Administered with gravity and grief
- Proportional to the offense

### Church and State

**Distinct Spheres:**
- Church governs spiritual matters
- State governs civil matters
- Neither should usurp the other's role

**Cooperation:**
- Both are ordained by God
- Both serve God's purposes
- May cooperate for common good
- Church does not depend on state for authority

## Constraints

- Scripture is the final authority for church governance, not tradition or pragmatism
- No structure can replace the need for godly character in leaders
- Polity serves the church; the church does not serve the polity
- Flexibility in application while maintaining core principles
- Cultural context matters but does not override biblical principles

## Example

**Input:** "Our church of about 150 people has always been led by a single senior pastor who makes most decisions. We're growing and want to transition to a more biblical governance model. How should we proceed?"

**Output:**

## Reformed Church Governance: Transitioning from Solo Pastor to Plural Eldership

### The Question
How can a growing congregation transition from single-pastor leadership to a biblical model of plural eldership while maintaining unity and effectiveness?

### Biblical Foundation

**Plurality of Elders:**
- Acts 14:23: Paul appointed elders (plural) in every church
- Acts 20:17, 28: Paul summoned the elders (plural) of Ephesus
- Titus 1:5: Appoint elders (plural) in every town
- 1 Peter 5:1-2: Peter addresses elders (plural) to shepherd the flock

**Qualifications:**
- 1 Timothy 3:1-7 and Titus 1:5-9 define elder qualifications
- Character is primary; ability to teach is essential

**Shared Authority:**
- No single individual should bear sole authority
- Mutual accountability protects against error and abuse
- Collective wisdom exceeds individual wisdom

### Recommended Structure

**Offices:**

*Pastor (Teaching Elder):*
Your current pastor would become one among equals in governance while retaining the distinct role of primary preaching/teaching. His role shifts from "senior leader" to "first among equals" with specialized teaching function.

*Ruling Elders:*
Identify and train 3-5 godly men who meet biblical qualifications. They will:
- Govern alongside the pastor
- Share in pastoral visitation
- Participate in discipline decisions
- Provide accountability for the pastor

*Deacons:*
Appoint 2-4 deacons to handle practical ministry:
- Benevolence and care for the needy
- Facility and financial administration
- Freeing elders for Word and prayer

**Governing Body:**

*Session/Elder Board:*
- Pastor + ruling elders meet regularly (weekly or biweekly)
- Major decisions require consensus or supermajority
- Pastor does not have veto power
- Minutes kept; accountability maintained

*Deacon Board:*
- Handles practical matters
- Reports to session
- Does not govern spiritual affairs

*Congregational Meetings:*
- Annual meeting for budget, elder/deacon confirmation
- Congregation has voice but not vote on most decisions
- Major decisions (property, pastoral calls) may require congregational approval

**Authority and Accountability:**

*Pastor:*
- Accountable to the session
- Performance reviewed annually by elders
- No unilateral decision-making on major matters

*Elders:*
- Accountable to one another and to Scripture
- Congregation can raise concerns through proper channels
- Subject to same discipline as any member

### Implementation

**Immediate Steps (Months 1-3):**
1. Preach a series on biblical church governance to educate the congregation
2. Have honest conversation with current pastor about role transition
3. Identify potential elder candidates (observe character over time)
4. Begin informal training of potential elders

**Development Phase (Months 4-9):**
1. Formal elder training program (Reformed polity, theology, pastoral care)
2. Candidates observed by congregation
3. Draft governance documents (constitution, bylaws)
4. Candidates examined by pastor (and outside elders if possible)

**Transition Phase (Months 10-12):**
1. Congregation affirms elder candidates
2. Public ordination/installation service
3. First session meeting to organize
4. Deacons nominated and installed
5. Governance documents adopted

**Ongoing Practices:**
- Weekly session meetings for first year, then as needed
- Annual review of governance effectiveness
- Continuous elder development and succession planning
- Regular communication with congregation

**Potential Challenges:**

*Pastor Resistance:*
If the pastor is accustomed to sole authority, this transition may feel like demotion. Address this by:
- Affirming his unique teaching gifts
- Showing how shared leadership protects and supports him
- Demonstrating biblical warrant for plurality

*Power Vacuum Concerns:*
Some may worry decisions will slow down. Address by:
- Clarifying which decisions require session vs. individual action
- Empowering pastor for day-to-day decisions
- Establishing clear processes for urgent matters

*Finding Qualified Men:*
Small churches may struggle to find enough qualified elders. Consider:
- Starting with 2-3 elders, even if fewer than ideal
- Developing men over time rather than rushing
- Partnering with other churches for training and examination

### Alignment Check

- [x] **Plurality of leadership** - Multiple elders share governance
- [x] **Distinct offices by function** - Pastor teaches, elders govern, deacons serve
- [x] **Representative governance** - Congregation has voice in affirming leaders
- [x] **Scripture as final authority** - Polity grounded in biblical texts
- [x] **Pastoral concern for souls** - Structure serves spiritual health, not bureaucracy
