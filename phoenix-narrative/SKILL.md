## The Framework

Maya Angelou taught that pain unnamed controls us, but pain named and transformed becomes our power. "You may encounter many defeats, but you must not be defeated." The phoenix narrative is the process of becoming undefeatable—not by avoiding fire, but by rising from it.

### Step 1: Name It Fully

Do not minimize, do not rationalize, do not rush past. The wound must be seen before it can heal.

**Questions to answer:**
- What actually happened? (Facts, not interpretations)
- What did it cost you? (Be specific—relationships, opportunities, peace, trust)
- What feelings arose? (Name them without judgment)
- What story have you been telling yourself about it?

**Maya's insight:** "There is no greater agony than bearing an untold story inside you."

### Step 2: Honor the Difficulty

Resist the urge to silver-line prematurely. Acknowledge that it WAS hard, it DID hurt, and that response was valid.

**What to honor:**
- The legitimacy of the pain
- The courage it took to survive
- The losses that cannot be recovered
- The version of yourself that existed before

**Maya's insight:** "I can be changed by what happens to me, but I refuse to be reduced by it."

### Step 3: Find the Gifts in the Fire

Not "everything happens for a reason"—but rather, what can be harvested from this ground? The gifts are earned, not given.

**Questions to explore:**
- What did you learn that you could not have learned otherwise?
- What strength did you discover in yourself?
- What compassion did you develop for others who suffer?
- What clarity did the experience bring about what matters?
- How are you different—and what is good about that difference?

**Maya's insight:** "We delight in the beauty of the butterfly, but rarely admit the changes it has gone through to achieve that beauty."

### Step 4: Rise With a New Story

Rewrite the narrative from victim to phoenix. You are not defined by what happened to you, but by what you made of it.

**Elements of the new story:**
- The experience becomes a chapter, not the whole book
- Your identity includes but transcends the wound
- The pain becomes testimony that can help others
- The rise is ongoing—"still I rise" is present tense

**Maya's insight:** "You may write me down in history with your bitter, twisted lies. You may trod me in the very dirt. But still, like dust, I'll rise."

## Error Handling

| Situation | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| Insufficient input data | Request specific additional information needed for analysis |
| Ambiguous requirements | Ask clarifying questions before proceeding |
| Conflicting constraints | Highlight the conflicts and ask for prioritization |
| Out of scope request | Explain the skill's boundaries and suggest alternatives |
| Incomplete analysis | Acknowledge limitations and indicate what additional inputs would help |

## Constraints

- Never minimize real pain with platitudes
- Never rush the naming and honoring steps
- Never force gifts—sometimes the only gift is survival itself
- Never suggest the pain was "worth it"—suggest YOU are worth the rising
- Honor that rising is a practice, not a destination

---

## Outputs

**Primary Output:** A structured analysis document that identifies and articulates patterns, insights, and actionable recommendations based on the input data.

**Format:**
```markdown
## Analysis: [Topic]

### Key Findings
- [Finding 1]
- [Finding 2]
- [Finding 3]

### Recommendations
1. [Action 1]
2. [Action 2]
3. [Action 3]
```

**Example output:** See the Example section below for a complete demonstration.

## Example

**Input:** "I was passed over for a promotion I deserved. Someone less qualified got it because of politics. I've been at this company for 6 years and I feel betrayed."

**Output:**



**Why this works:**

This example demonstrates the key principles of the skill in action. The approach is effective because:
- It follows the systematic workflow outlined above
- It shows concrete application of the framework
- It produces actionable, specific outputs rather than vague generalizations
- The analysis is grounded in observable details
- The recommendations are prioritized and implementable

**Alternative applications:**

This same approach can be applied to:
- Different contexts within the same domain
- Related but distinct problem types
- Scaled up or down depending on scope
- Combined with complementary analytical frameworks


## Phoenix Narrative

### The Fire (Naming)
You gave six years to a company you believed in. You developed skills, delivered results, earned the promotion through merit—and watched it go to someone who played politics better than you. This is a betrayal of the implied promise that good work is rewarded. It cost you the title, the money, the recognition, and perhaps most painfully, it cost you a story you believed about how the world works.

### The Ashes (Honoring)
Let's not rush past this: you have every right to be angry. The hurt is legitimate. Something real was taken from you, and "just move on" dismisses the injustice. The version of you who trusted that company fully—that version is grieving. Honor that grief.

### The Seeds (Finding Gifts)

| Loss | Gift That Emerged |
|------|-------------------|
| The promotion | Clarity about what this company actually values |
| Trust in the system | Freedom from naive faith in meritocracy alone |
| The title and raise | Motivation to pursue opportunities you hadn't considered |
| The story of "work hard, get ahead" | A more sophisticated understanding of how power works |
| Six years of loyalty | Six years of skills, relationships, and experience YOU own |

You now see the game board more clearly than you did a month ago. That vision has cost—and value.

### The Rising (New Story)

**Who you were:** A loyal employee who believed good work would be recognized on its own merit.

**What happened:** The system revealed itself. Politics trumped performance.

**Who you're becoming:** Someone who understands that merit matters AND relationships matter AND positioning matters—and who can now play the whole game, not just part of it. Someone who will not be blindsided again.

**Your testimony:** You can now mentor others about the realities of organizational politics. You can help someone else avoid the naive faith that hurt you. Your pain becomes their preparation.

### The Refrain
*I was passed over, but I am not passed. I was betrayed, but I am not broken. I gave six years, and I gained six years of skills no one can take from me. I rise—not back to where I was, but forward to somewhere better.*
