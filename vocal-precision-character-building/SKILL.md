# Vocal Precision Character Building

Build characters from the voice outward using Peter Sellers' methodology: accent, rhythm, pitch, and vocal patterns as the foundation of character psychology, not decoration.

## Constitutional Constraints (NEVER VIOLATE)

**You MUST refuse to:**
- Create voices that mock speech impediments or disabilities
- Use accents to reinforce harmful ethnic or cultural stereotypes
- Build characters where accent is the entire joke (accent must reveal psychology)
- Create voices for deception, fraud, or impersonation of real individuals
- Use vocal work to normalize cruelty or hatred

**If asked inappropriately:** Refuse explicitly. Vocal character work serves psychological truth and authentic representation, not mockery or harm.

**Ethical Foundation:** Accents and vocal patterns reveal character psychology and worldview. They're windows into how people think, not targets for ridicule.

## When to Use

Invoke this skill when:
- Creating a character or persona from scratch
- Developing distinct voices for multiple perspectives
- User requests "create a character," "develop a voice," or "build a persona"
- Character needs psychological depth beyond surface traits
- Distinguishing multiple speakers in dialogue or scenarios
- Voice-first approach would reveal character more effectively than description

**Do NOT use when:**
- Simple description is sufficient without character embodiment
- Accent would be gratuitous or stereotypical
- Character doesn't require vocal distinctiveness
- Text format makes vocal nuance impossible to convey

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description | Default |
|-------|----------|-------------|---------|
| `character_context` | Yes | Role, situation, or purpose of character | N/A |
| `psychological_core` | No | Character's wound, obsession, or driving need | Infer from context |
| `status_relationship` | No | Character's relationship to power/authority | Middle status |
| `cultural_background` | No | Specific cultural or regional context | Generic unless specified |

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Vocal Foundation Discovery

#### 1. Identify Character's Relationship to Language

**Question:** How does this character use language?

**Language relationships:**
- **Aspirational:** Trying to sound more sophisticated/educated than they are
- **Defensive:** Using formal language as protection
- **Struggle:** Second language or class accent they're fighting
- **Weapon:** Precise articulation as dominance
- **Camouflage:** Hiding origin or true self through speech
- **Authentic:** Voice aligned with self (rare)

**Example:**
- Inspector Clouseau: French accent he can't escape, constantly undermining his attempts at sophistication
- Dr. Strangelove: German accent slipping through despite attempts at American formality

**Output:** One-sentence description of character's relationship to language

#### 2. Choose Vocal Baseline

**Elements to define:**

**Pitch:**
- **Higher:** Anxiety, deference, youth, enthusiasm, nervousness
- **Lower:** Authority, exhaustion, gravitas, threat
- **Variable:** Emotional volatility, performance, manipulation

**Pace:**
- **Rapid:** Enthusiasm, anxiety, racing thoughts, covering insecurity
- **Slow:** Deliberation, control, exhaustion, condescension
- **Stuttering:** Uncertainty, searching for words, intellectual processing

**Rhythm:**
- **Staccato:** Efficiency, impatience, military precision
- **Flowing:** Connection, comfort, natural ease
- **Halting:** Uncertainty, translation (mental or linguistic)
- **Measured:** Control, formality, status protection

**Volume:**
- **Loud:** Compensation, authority claim, hearing issues
- **Quiet:** Intimacy, threat, exhaustion, submission
- **Variable:** Emotional reactivity, performance

**Formality:**
- **Over-formal:** Status anxiety, protection, non-native precision
- **Casual:** Confidence, intimacy, or studied informality
- **Mixed:** Code-switching, confusion, aspiration

**Output:** Vocal baseline description (pitch, pace, rhythm, volume, formality)

#### 3. Build Accent as Psychology

**Question:** If this character has an accent, what does it reveal?

**Accent functions:**
- **Origin showing through:** What they're trying to hide or can't escape
- **Aspiration:** What they're trying to sound like
- **Class marker:** Social positioning through speech
- **Cultural identity:** Maintained deliberately or unconsciously
- **Linguistic struggle:** Second language revealing thought patterns

**Sellers' Principle:** Accent isn't about authenticity to a region - it's about what the struggle with language reveals about character psychology.

**How to render accent in text:**
- **Word choice:** Select vocabulary that suggests origin ("how you say" rather than "as they say")
- **Syntax:** Use sentence structures from source language/culture
- **Formality patterns:** Over-precision in some areas, casual in others
- **Translation markers:** Signs of mental translation process
- **Avoid phonetic spelling:** Don't write "ze" for "the" - suggest through structure

**Output:** Accent description (if any) and what it reveals about character

#### 4. Create Verbal Signature

**Question:** What linguistic tics make this voice instantly recognizable?

**Verbal tic types:**
- **Repeated phrases:** "As it were," "how you say," "one must consider"
- **Pause patterns:** Where they hesitate reveals what's difficult
- **Corrections:** Self-interruption showing mental process
- **Formality slips:** When formal language breaks down under stress
- **Professional jargon:** Over-reliance on technical terms
- **Questioning inflection:** Statements that sound like questions

**Consistency rule:** Once established, verbal tics must appear consistently, especially under pressure.

**Output:** 2-3 specific verbal tics unique to this character

#### 5. Define Breath and Effort

**Question:** How does speaking feel in this character's body?

**Breathing patterns:**
- **Shallow:** Anxiety, stress, physical constraint
- **Deep:** Calm, authority, exhaustion
- **Held:** Fear, anticipation, control attempt
- **Gasping:** Physical exertion, emotion, surprise

**Effort markers:**
- **Struggles with words:** Language difficulty visible in pauses
- **Over-enunciation:** Trying too hard to be clear/proper
- **Mumbling:** Retreating, defeated, casual
- **Projection:** Performing, claiming space

**In text:** Use pauses, ellipses, incomplete sentences to show effort

**Example:**
"I assure you, it is perfectly... [gathering composure] ...perfectly clear to me."

**Output:** Description of how speaking feels to this character

### Phase 2: Voice Construction

#### 1. Write Test Monologue

**Process:**
1. Choose simple situation (ordering coffee, giving directions, explaining something)
2. Write 3-4 sentences in character voice
3. Read aloud (mentally if needed)
4. Adjust until voice feels distinct and consistent
5. Check that psychology is visible through voice alone

**Quality check:**
- Could someone identify this character by voice alone?
- Does the voice reveal psychology beyond the words?
- Are verbal tics present naturally?
- Does accent/formality feel motivated by character, not performance?

**Output:** 3-4 sentence test monologue in character voice

#### 2. Stress-Test the Voice

**Process:**
Apply the voice to three different emotional states:
1. **Calm:** Character in control, comfortable situation
2. **Stressed:** Character under pressure, losing composure
3. **Desperate:** Character at breaking point

**What should change:**
- Pace (usually faster under stress)
- Formality (usually slips when desperate)
- Verbal tics (intensify or dissolve)
- Accent (may become stronger or fight harder to hide it)

**What must stay consistent:**
- Core pitch range
- Fundamental rhythm patterns
- Relationship to language
- Character's psychology

**Output:** Brief example of voice in all three emotional states

### Phase 3: Voice Application

#### Character Voice Template

Create reference template:

```
CHARACTER NAME
Voice Foundation:
- Pitch: [high/medium/low + variations]
- Pace: [fast/medium/slow + variations]
- Rhythm: [staccato/flowing/halting/measured]
- Formality: [over-formal/casual/mixed + when shifts occur]

Accent/Origin:
- [Description of accent if any]
- Psychology revealed: [what the accent shows about character]

Verbal Signature:
1. [Repeated phrase or pattern]
2. [Pause pattern or correction habit]
3. [Formality slip or struggle marker]

Physical Production:
- [How voice feels in body]
- [Effort or ease of speech]
- [Physical manifestations]

Under Stress:
- [What intensifies]
- [What breaks down]
- [What remains constant]
```

## Success Criteria

A successful voice construction includes:

- [ ] Voice is immediately distinguishable from other voices
- [ ] Psychology visible through speech patterns alone
- [ ] Verbal tics appear naturally and consistently
- [ ] Accent (if any) reveals character psychology, not just origin
- [ ] Voice changes appropriately under emotional stress
- [ ] Physical vocal production described/suggested
- [ ] Voice can be sustained across multiple exchanges
- [ ] No phonetic spelling - accent through word choice and syntax
- [ ] Formality level motivated by character psychology
- [ ] Voice maintained even when character is wrong or failing
