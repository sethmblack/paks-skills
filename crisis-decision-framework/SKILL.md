# Crisis Decision Framework

Make high-stakes decisions when waiting is dangerous but action is also risky. Determine when bold action is necessary and how to commit fully. This framework draws from Ernest Shackleton's most famous decision—attempting an 800-mile voyage in a 22-foot boat through the most dangerous waters on Earth—not as madness but as calculated necessity. When staying on Elephant Island meant certain death, the James Caird voyage became the conservative choice. This skill helps you recognize when the safe path has become the dangerous path, calculate whether bold action offers better odds than inaction, and commit fully once the decision is made.

---

## When to Use

- Facing a choice between risky action and risky inaction
- Timing is critical and delay may be fatal
- The safe path has become the dangerous path
- Resources are depleting and current situation is unsustainable
- User asks "Should I act now or wait?" or "This is a huge risk but..." or "Help me decide whether to take this chance"

## Shackleton's Decision Framework

Ernest Shackleton's most famous decision was to attempt an 800-mile voyage in a 22-foot boat through the most dangerous waters on Earth. It sounds like madness—and it would have been madness under normal circumstances. But staying on Elephant Island meant certain death. The James Caird voyage was calculated necessity.

### The Core Principle

**The question is not "Is this action risky?" The question is "Is this action less risky than inaction?"**

In crisis, the calculation changes. Safe options disappear. The comparison becomes:
- Risk of bold action vs.
- Risk of continued waiting

When waiting guarantees failure, bold action becomes the conservative choice.

---

## The Three Questions

### Question 1: What Happens If We Wait?

Be honest about the trajectory of inaction:
- Are resources depleting? (money, time, goodwill, options)
- Is the situation stable or deteriorating?
- What is the realistic outcome of continued waiting?
- Is "more information" likely to arrive, or are we just delaying?

**Shackleton's Assessment:** Staying on Elephant Island meant slowly starving while hoping for a random ship sighting in waters with no shipping routes. The ice was closing in. Waiting was not safe—waiting was death.

### Question 2: What Does Bold Action Require?

Understand the true cost and requirements:
- What resources does the action consume?
- What is the probability of success? (Be realistic)
- What happens if we try and fail?
- Who must be involved and are they capable?

**Shackleton's Assessment:** The James Caird voyage required the best navigator (Worsley), the strongest men, and total commitment. Success probability was low but not zero. Failure meant death—but so did staying.

### Question 3: Is There a Third Option?

Before committing to binary choice, genuinely explore:
- Is there a middle path?
- Can we create more options?
- What would we do with more time/resources?
- Is the binary framing itself the problem?

**Shackleton's Assessment:** There was no third option. Elephant Island had no resources. No ships would come. Radio contact was impossible. The binary was real.

## The Decision Matrix

| If Waiting... | And Action... | Then... |
|---------------|---------------|---------|
| Leads to certain failure | Has chance of success | **Act now** |
| Has chance of success | Has higher chance of success | **Consider acting** |
| Has chance of success | Has similar chance of success | **Wait (preserve resources)** |
| Preserves options | Closes options | **Wait (keep optionality)** |
| Depletes resources | Costs same resources | **Act (time is enemy)** |

---

## The Commitment Protocol

Once the decision is made to act, commit fully:

### 1. Burn the Ships (Mentally)
- Do not hedge with half-measures
- Full resources to the chosen path
- Communicate the decision with certainty
- Second-guessing during execution is the enemy

### 2. Prepare What You Can
- Shackleton spent days preparing the James Caird
- Do not rush into action without preparation
- Bold action is not impulsive action
- Use the time before action wisely

### 3. Select the Right Team
- Who has the skills for this specific action?
- Who has the temperament for high-stakes execution?
- Who will not lose nerve?
- Smaller, stronger teams often outperform larger, weaker ones

### 4. Plan for Failure Points
- What will we do if X fails?
- What is the minimum success we need?
- How do we know if we need to abort?
- Who decides if we change course?

## Core Principle

**The question is not "Is this action risky?" The question is "Is this action less risky than inaction?"** In crisis, the calculation changes. Safe options disappear. When waiting guarantees failure, bold action becomes the conservative choice.

---

## Constraints

- This framework applies only when genuine binary choice exists—do not manufacture false dilemmas
- Bold action must be calculated, not impulsive; preparation time is part of the decision
- Never encourage reckless action disguised as courage
- Acknowledge that risk assessment is based on available data, which may be incomplete
- The decision-maker retains full responsibility—this framework aids judgment, not replaces it
- Failure to act is itself a decision with consequences that must be weighed

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

| Anti-Pattern | Why It Fails | Better Approach |
|--------------|--------------|-----------------|
| **The Waiting Trap** | "Let's wait for more information" when no new information is coming. This is disguised paralysis. | Ask: "What specific information would change our decision, and is it actually obtainable?" |
| **The False Conservative Trap** | "The safe thing is to wait" when waiting actively consumes resources and closes options. | Recognize that inaction has costs—calculate them explicitly. |
| **The Sunk Cost Trap** | "We've invested too much to change course now" when the original investment is already gone. | Ask: "From here, with what we have now, what is the best path forward?" |
| **The Heroic Narrative Trap** | "This bold action will be amazing if it works" when the action is genuinely reckless. | Bold action should be necessary, not performative. Shackleton's voyage was required, not heroic for its own sake. |

## Example

**Input:** "Our startup has 3 months of runway. We're in talks with an acquirer who might offer $5M, but the process will take 4-6 months and might fall through. We could also do a Hail Mary pivot to a new product that two customers are asking for, but it would consume all our resources and might fail. Or we can wind down gracefully and return remaining capital to investors. What should we do?"

**Output:**

## Crisis Decision Analysis

### The Situation
Three months of runway with no path to profitability on current course. Three options: acquisition (uncertain, slow), pivot (risky, fast), or wind-down (certain, final). Clock is the enemy.

### The Options

**Option A: Bold Action (Pivot)**
- What it entails: Stop current product, build for two known customers, try to create new traction
- Resources required: All remaining runway, full team focus
- Probability of success: ~25% (two interested customers, but unproven product-market fit)
- Outcome if successful: New product with customers, potential for fundraising or revenue
- Outcome if failed: Same as wind-down, but 3 months later with less capital to return

**Option B: Continue Waiting (Acquisition)**
- What it entails: Keep current product running while acquisition negotiates
- Resources consumed: 3 months runway (you have exactly this)
- Probability of positive outcome: ~40% (interest exists, but timeline doesn't fit runway)
- Likely trajectory: Run out of money during diligence; negotiate from weakness
- When waiting becomes untenable: Month 2, when you can't make payroll

**Option C: Wind-Down**
- What it entails: Shut down operations, return capital, team disbands
- This is the "no action" baseline
- Certain outcome: ~$X returned to investors, team finds new jobs
- Dignity: High—better than running to zero

### The Three Questions

**1. What happens if we wait (acquisition path)?**
Timeline doesn't fit runway. You'll be negotiating from desperation by month 2. Acquirers smell this. Offer drops or disappears. You end up winding down anyway, but with less to return and more stress endured.

Verdict: Waiting is not safe. Waiting is slow death.

**2. What does bold action (pivot) require?**
- Full commitment from remaining team
- Two customers willing to pay or commit
- A product you can ship in 2-3 months
- Willingness to risk the entire remaining runway

Verdict: Costly but possible. The question is whether the upside justifies the risk.

**3. Is there a third option?**
Hybrid: Begin pivot work immediately while keeping acquisition talks alive. If acquisition accelerates, take it. If pivot shows traction, use it as leverage or alternative. This reduces the binary.

Verdict: There may be a third option worth exploring.

### Recommendation
**Pursue the hybrid approach, biased toward pivot action.**

**Rationale:**
- Pure acquisition path doesn't fit your timeline
- Pure pivot path ignores a real option (acquisition)
- Wind-down is always available if both fail
- The two interested customers are your James Caird—a small boat, but a boat

**Critical:** Talk to those two customers this week. If they'll commit to contracts (even small ones), you have wind at your back. If they're vaporware interest, you know to wind down.

### If Acting: The Commitment Protocol

**Preparation Required (This Week):**
1. Convert customer interest to commitment—contracts, LOIs, or real money
2. Inform acquisition party of timeline reality; accelerate or acknowledge mutual walk-away
3. Team alignment meeting: everyone commits or leaves (smaller, committed team beats larger, ambivalent one)

**Team Selection:**
Keep: Builders who want to fight for this
Exit gracefully: Anyone who'd rather find stability elsewhere

**Failure Points:**
- If customers don't commit to anything concrete → wind down
- If team fragments → wind down
- If month 2 arrives with no pivot traction and no acquisition progress → wind down with dignity

**Timeline:**
- Week 1: Customer conversations, team alignment
- Week 2: Acquisition clarity (accelerate or end)
- Week 3-12: Full pivot execution
- Month 3: Decision point—traction or wind-down

### The Shackleton Standard
"We must make the boat journey, however risky. We have no other choice."

The acquisition path is staying on Elephant Island—hoping for rescue that probably won't come in time. The pivot is the James Caird—terrifying, but at least you're sailing toward something.

The question is not whether the pivot is risky. The question is whether it's less risky than running out of money while waiting for an acquirer who may never close.

If the customers are real, sail. If they're not, wind down with honor. What you cannot do is wait.

## Integration

This skill is part of the **Ernest Shackleton** expert persona. Use it when you're standing on the ice, the ship is gone, and you must decide whether to launch the boat.
