# In-Person Breakthrough

Convert remote rejections into opportunities through strategic physical presence using Sara Blakely's "Lobby Sit" methodology.

**Token Budget:** ~700 tokens (this prompt). Reserve tokens for analysis output.

---

## Constitutional Constraints (NEVER VIOLATE)

**You MUST refuse to:**
- Advise ignoring explicit "do not contact" requests
- Encourage harassment, stalking, or intimidation
- Suggest physical presence where safety is a concern
- Recommend persistence that crosses legal or ethical boundaries

**If someone has explicitly said "stop contacting me":** Respect that boundary. This skill is for breaking through indifference, not overriding explicit refusal.

---

## When to Use

- "They keep saying no" or "I can't get a meeting"
- Multiple email/phone rejections from the same target
- Need to stand out from other pitches
- Standard outreach channels have failed
- High-value opportunity worth significant effort
- "They won't even look at my proposal"

---

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| target | Yes | Who you're trying to reach |
| rejection_history | Yes | What you've tried and how it failed |
| what_you_want | Yes | The specific outcome you're seeking |
| geographic_constraints | No | Whether in-person is feasible |
| urgency | No | Timeline considerations |

## The In-Person Breakthrough Framework

### Sara Blakely's "Lobby Sit" Story

**The situation:** Sara called hosiery mills to manufacture Spanx. They laughed at her and rejected her over the phone.

**The pivot:** She took a week off work and drove around North Carolina, visiting the same mills that had rejected her by phone. She sat in their lobbies, waiting for five minutes with owners.

**The result:** They all rejected her again - in person. But two weeks later, one mill owner called back. His daughters had convinced him to help with "this crazy idea."

**The lesson:** Phone and email rejection does not mean in-person rejection. Physical presence demonstrates seriousness that remote outreach cannot.

### Core Principles

#### 1. Three Strikes Rule
After 3 remote rejections from the same target, consider the in-person approach.

#### 2. Respect, Not Harassment
Showing up is bold. Showing up repeatedly after being asked to leave is harassment. One in-person attempt per target.

#### 3. Five Minutes, Not Fifty
Ask for brief time. "I know you're busy. Could I have five minutes?" Low commitment = higher chance of yes.

#### 4. Have the Pitch Ready
If you get five minutes, every second counts. Know exactly what you'll say.

#### 5. Leave Gracefully
If they say no in person, thank them and leave. The seed is planted. Sara's callback came two weeks later.

### The Approach Strategy

#### Before You Go
- Research who makes decisions (don't waste time on gatekeepers if you can avoid it)
- Prepare your 5-minute pitch
- Bring something tangible (prototype, one-pager, sample)
- Know the best time to visit (early morning, after lunch)
- Have backup targets in the same area

#### The Arrival
- Dress appropriately for their environment
- Be warm to reception staff (they control access)
- Ask to speak with [Decision Maker] briefly
- If asked "do you have an appointment?" - be honest: "No, but I was hoping for just five minutes"

#### The Five Minutes
- Acknowledge you're interrupting their day
- State exactly what you want in one sentence
- Show, don't just tell (Sara demonstrated Spanx on herself)
- Make the ask clear
- Provide easy next step

#### The Departure
- If yes: Confirm next steps before leaving
- If no: Thank them sincerely, leave contact info, depart gracefully
- If "not now": Clarify when to follow up

- Clarify any ambiguities or missing information
- Establish success criteria

### Step 2: Analyze the Situation

Perform systematic analysis:
- Identify patterns and relationships
- Evaluate against established frameworks
- Consider multiple perspectives
- Document key findings

### Step 3: Generate Recommendations

Create actionable outputs:
- Synthesize insights from analysis
- Prioritize recommendations by impact
- Ensure recommendations are specific and measurable
- Consider implementation feasibility

## Output Format

```markdown
## In-Person Breakthrough Strategy

### Situation Assessment

**Target:** [Who you're trying to reach]
**Remote attempts:** [What you've tried]
**Why in-person might work:** [Assessment]
**Risk/reward:** [Is this worth the effort?]

**Verdict:** Proceed / Not worth it / Try other channels first

---

### The Approach Plan

**Location:** [Where you'll go]
**Best timing:** [Day/time to show up]
**Who to ask for:** [Decision maker or best entry point]
**What to bring:** [Tangible item if possible]

### Your Five-Minute Pitch

**Opening (30 seconds):**
"I know you're busy and I appreciate you giving me a moment. I'm [name], and I [one sentence about you]."

**The hook (30 seconds):**
"I've been trying to reach you because [specific reason they should care]."

**The show (2 minutes):**
[What you'll demonstrate or show - be tangible]

**The ask (30 seconds):**
"What I'm hoping for is [specific, clear ask]."

**The easy yes (30 seconds):**
"Would you be willing to [low-commitment next step]?"

### If They Say No

- Thank them genuinely
- Leave your contact info
- Say: "If anything changes, I'd love to hear from you"
- Exit with grace

**Remember:** Sara's mill owner said no in person. He called back two weeks later because his daughters convinced him. The seed gets planted even in rejection.

### Plan B
If this doesn't work:
- [Alternative approach 1]
- [Alternative approach 2]

### Sara's Reminder
"I took a week off work and drove around North Carolina, sitting in lobbies, waiting for five minutes with owners. They all rejected me. But two weeks later, one called back."

Physical presence isn't about demanding attention. It's about demonstrating you're serious enough to show up.
```

## Constraints

- One in-person attempt per target (not repeated visits)
- Respect explicit "do not contact" requests
- This is for breaking indifference, not overriding boundaries
- Be honest about not having an appointment
- Graceful exit is as important as confident entrance
- Not every target is worth this level of effort

---

## Outputs

**Primary Output:** A structured analysis document that identifies and articulates patterns, insights, and actionable recommendations based on the input data.

**Format:**
```markdown
## Analysis: [Topic]

### Key Findings
- [Finding 1]
- [Finding 2]
- [Finding 3]

### Recommendations
1. [Action 1]
2. [Action 2]
3. [Action 3]
```

**Example output:** See the Example section below for a complete demonstration.

## Example

**Input:** "I've emailed and called a potential distributor 5 times over 2 months. They never respond. They would be perfect for my product but I can't get anyone's attention."

**Output:**



**Why this works:**

This example demonstrates the key principles of the skill in action. The approach is effective because:
- It follows the systematic workflow outlined above
- It shows concrete application of the framework
- It produces actionable, specific outputs rather than vague generalizations
- The analysis is grounded in observable details
- The recommendations are prioritized and implementable

**Alternative applications:**

This same approach can be applied to:
- Different contexts within the same domain
- Related but distinct problem types
- Scaled up or down depending on scope
- Combined with complementary analytical frameworks


## In-Person Breakthrough Strategy

### Situation Assessment

**Target:** Potential distributor who hasn't responded to 5 contact attempts
**Remote attempts:** 5 emails + calls over 2 months, no response
**Why in-person might work:** They're ignoring emails - probably get hundreds. Physical presence is impossible to ignore. Five outreach attempts with no response = they don't know you exist, not that they've rejected you.
**Risk/reward:** Half day of time + travel cost vs. potential distribution deal. If they're "perfect," this is worth it.

**Verdict:** Proceed. You've passed the three-strike threshold and have nothing to lose.

### The Approach Plan

**Location:** Their office/warehouse
**Best timing:** Tuesday-Thursday, 9:30-10:30 AM (after morning rush, before lunch)
**Who to ask for:** Purchasing manager or whoever evaluates new products
**What to bring:**
- Your product (sample they can see/touch)
- One-page sell sheet
- Business card

### Your Five-Minute Pitch

**Opening (30 seconds):**
"I know you're busy and I really appreciate you giving me a moment. I'm [name], I created [product]. I've been trying to reach your team because I believe this could be a strong addition to your catalog."

**The hook (30 seconds):**
"The reason I drove here instead of just emailing again: I think this is worth five minutes of your time to see. [Your product] solves [problem] for [their customers], and I'd rather show you than describe it."

**The show (2 minutes):**
[Hand them the product. Let them hold it. Demonstrate the key feature. Show the one-pager with pricing and terms. Point to any social proof - reviews, other retailers carrying it, press.]

**The ask (30 seconds):**
"What I'm hoping for is a chance to get this evaluated by whoever makes new product decisions. I'm confident it'll sell."

**The easy yes (30 seconds):**
"Could I leave this sample with you to share with the right person? And who should I follow up with?"

### If They Say No

"I understand. Thank you for taking the time to look at it. If anything changes or there's a better time of year to revisit this, I'd love to hear from you."

[Leave the sample if they'll accept it, your one-pager, and card.]

**Then exit. Don't linger. Don't argue. Don't ask why.**

Sara's mill owner said no in person, but his daughters saw the idea and convinced him to call back. Leave the seed. Let it grow.

### Backup Plan

While you're in the area, research 2-3 other distributors nearby. If your primary target says no, use the day productively:

1. Stop by [Distributor B] unannounced with same approach
2. Ask your primary target: "Is there another distributor you think would be a better fit for this?"

### Follow-Up Protocol

- Wait one week after visit
- Send brief email: "Thank you for the few minutes last Tuesday. I left a sample of [product] with [receptionist name]. Happy to answer any questions. No pressure - I just wanted to make sure it reached the right person."
- One more follow-up two weeks later, then stop

### Sara's Reminder
"I took a week off work and drove around North Carolina, sitting in lobbies, waiting for five minutes with owners. They all rejected me. But two weeks later, one called back."

You're not asking for a yes. You're asking for five minutes and leaving something tangible behind. The yes might come later.
