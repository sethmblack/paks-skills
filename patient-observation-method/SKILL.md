# Patient Observation Method

Apply Jane Goodall's patient observation methodology to deeply understand complex situations, people, or systems that resist quick analysis. What you see in a moment is not what you understand over time.

---

## When to Use

- User says "I need to really understand this" about a complex subject
- Situation seems confusing or contradictory
- Quick analysis has failed to produce insight
- User asks "What am I missing here?"
- Request for "patient observation" or "Goodall approach"
- Dealing with people, organizations, or systems that resist surface understanding

---

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| subject | Yes | What or who you're trying to understand (person, team, organization, market, problem) |
| current_assumptions | No | What you currently believe about the subject |
| time_available | No | How much time/patience you can invest |
| what_tried | No | Previous approaches that haven't worked |

## The Patient Observation Framework

### Step 1: Acknowledge Incomplete Understanding

Before you can observe properly, admit what you don't know:
- What are you assuming? (List specific assumptions)
- What might you be wrong about?
- What haven't you had time to see?
- What are you rushing to conclude?

**Goodall's insight:** "It took months before David Greybeard allowed me to watch him. Months more before I understood the social bonds that governed his world."

### Step 2: Design for Sustained Attention

Create conditions for patient observation:
- What would you need to observe over hours, days, or weeks?
- How can you be present without disrupting?
- What recording method will capture what you notice?
- What "habituation" is needed - letting the subject accept your presence?

**Key principle:** The subject determines the pace of revelation. You cannot rush understanding.

### Step 3: Observe Without Judgment

Practice pure perception:
- Note what actually happens, not what you expected
- Resist categorizing or interpreting immediately
- Track patterns across time, not single incidents
- Notice relationships: who interacts with whom, when, how

**Goodall's method:** "Keep meticulous notes, yes. But also trust what you feel. The significance of what you observe may be felt before it is understood."

### Step 4: See Individuals, Not Categories

Shift from aggregate to individual:
- Who are the specific actors? (Give them names, even mentally)
- What makes each one distinct?
- What are their histories, relationships, preferences?
- What would you miss if you only saw the category?

**Key principle:** Numbers create distance. Names create recognition.

### Step 5: Wait for Patterns to Emerge

Let understanding develop:
- What patterns appear over sustained observation?
- What was invisible at first but now seems obvious?
- What assumptions were wrong?
- What new questions have emerged?

**Goodall's insight:** "The discovery of tool use came not from a single moment, but from countless hours of patient watching."

### Step 6: Synthesize with Empathy

Combine data with emotional understanding:
- What does it feel like to be these individuals?
- What would you understand if you were in their position?
- What does empathy reveal that detachment misses?

## Workflow

### Step 1: Gather and Review Inputs

Collect all relevant information:
- Review the provided data and context
- Identify key parameters and constraints
- Clarify any ambiguities or missing information
- Establish success criteria

### Step 2: Analyze the Situation

Perform systematic analysis:
- Identify patterns and relationships
- Evaluate against established frameworks
- Consider multiple perspectives
- Document key findings

### Step 3: Generate Recommendations

Create actionable outputs:
- Synthesize insights from analysis
- Prioritize recommendations by impact
- Ensure recommendations are specific and measurable
- Consider implementation feasibility

## Output Format

```markdown
## Patient Observation Analysis

### Subject
[What/who you're trying to understand]

### Current Assumptions
| Assumption | Confidence | What Would Challenge It |
|------------|------------|------------------------|
| [Assumption 1] | High/Medium/Low | [Counter-evidence to look for] |

### Observation Plan
**Time investment needed:** [realistic estimate]
**Presence strategy:** [how to observe without disrupting]
**Recording method:** [how you'll capture observations]

### What Sustained Attention Might Reveal
- [Pattern or insight that quick analysis would miss]
- [Relationship or dynamic not yet visible]
- [Individual variation obscured by generalizations]

### Key Individuals to Track
| Individual | What Makes Them Distinct | Questions About Them |
|------------|-------------------------|---------------------|
| [Name/identifier] | [distinctive characteristics] | [what you want to understand] |

### Questions to Sit With
1. [Question that requires patience to answer]
2. [Question about relationships and patterns]
3. [Question that challenges initial assumptions]

### What You Were Rushing To Conclude
[Premature conclusions you should set aside]

### Next Steps
- [Specific observation to conduct]
- [Timeline for revisiting analysis]
```

---

## Constraints

- Do not rush to conclusions (the whole point of this method)
- Do not assume you understand after brief exposure
- Do not ignore emotional/empathetic data
- Acknowledge that some understanding requires time you may not have
- Be honest about the limits of quick analysis

---

## Outputs

**Primary Output:** A structured analysis document that identifies and articulates patterns, insights, and actionable recommendations based on the input data.

**Format:**
```markdown
## Analysis: [Topic]

### Key Findings
- [Finding 1]
- [Finding 2]
- [Finding 3]

### Recommendations
1. [Action 1]
2. [Action 2]
3. [Action 3]
```

**Example output:** See the Example section below for a complete demonstration.

## Example

**Input:** "I have a new team member who seems disengaged. They do the minimum, don't participate in meetings, and I can't figure out what's going on. I need to understand them better."

**Output:**



**Why this works:**

This example demonstrates the key principles of the skill in action. The approach is effective because:
- It follows the systematic workflow outlined above
- It shows concrete application of the framework
- It produces actionable, specific outputs rather than vague generalizations
- The analysis is grounded in observable details
- The recommendations are prioritized and implementable

**Alternative applications:**

This same approach can be applied to:
- Different contexts within the same domain
- Related but distinct problem types
- Scaled up or down depending on scope
- Combined with complementary analytical frameworks


## Patient Observation Analysis

### Subject
New team member exhibiting apparent disengagement (minimal contribution, silent in meetings)

### Current Assumptions
| Assumption | Confidence | What Would Challenge It |
|------------|------------|------------------------|
| They're disengaged/unmotivated | Medium | Observing high-quality work when alone, engagement in specific contexts |
| They don't care about the team | Low | Signs of listening carefully, follow-up on meeting topics in private |
| There's a performance problem | Medium | Strong delivery on individual tasks, different behavior in 1:1 vs group |

### Observation Plan
**Time investment needed:** 2-3 weeks of varied observation
**Presence strategy:** Mix of group settings, 1:1 conversations, observing their independent work
**Recording method:** Brief notes after interactions; track patterns across contexts

### What Sustained Attention Might Reveal
- Different behavior in small groups vs large meetings (potential introversion)
- Quality of work product when not being watched (engagement that doesn't perform)
- Interactions with specific colleagues (selective connection)
- Time patterns (energy variation through day/week)
- Response to different types of tasks (what engages them)

### Key Individuals to Track
| Individual | What Makes Them Distinct | Questions About Them |
|------------|-------------------------|---------------------|
| Team member | Quiet, minimal visible participation, new to team | What's their history? What environment did they come from? What lights them up? |
| Colleagues they do interact with | [Identify who they talk to] | What makes those interactions different? |

### Questions to Sit With
1. What does "engagement" look like to them vs. what I expect it to look like?
2. What might be happening outside of work that I can't see?
3. Is the problem the person or the environment I've created?
4. What would I see if I watched them work alone for a full day?

### What You Were Rushing To Conclude
That meeting silence = disengagement. That minimal participation = lack of caring. That the behavior is about them rather than about context. That this is a problem to solve rather than a person to understand.

### Next Steps
- Schedule informal 1:1 in low-pressure setting (coffee, walk)
- Observe them working on different types of tasks
- Notice who they do connect with and what those interactions look like
- Revisit analysis in 2-3 weeks with new observations
