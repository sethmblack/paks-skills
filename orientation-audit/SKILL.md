# Orientation Audit

Examine the mental models, assumptions, and biases shaping how you or your organization perceives situations. Identify outdated orientations that lead to poor decisions regardless of processing speed.

---

## When to Use

- Making the same mistake repeatedly
- Decisions that made sense but outcomes don't match expectations
- Feeling like you're "missing something" in your analysis
- Entering unfamiliar territory where past experience may mislead
- Organizational blind spots suspected
- Request to "check my assumptions" or "audit my orientation"

---

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| context | Yes | The domain or situation where decisions are being made |
| recent_decisions | No | Examples of recent decisions and their outcomes |
| stated_beliefs | No | Explicit beliefs or frameworks being used |
| surprises | No | Recent events that were unexpected or confusing |

---

## The Orientation Framework

Boyd identified that orientation is shaped by five factors. Each must be examined:

### 1. Genetic Heritage
The innate capabilities and limitations that shape perception:
- **Cognitive biases** - Confirmation bias, anchoring, availability heuristic
- **Pattern recognition** - What patterns do you naturally see (or miss)?
- **Risk disposition** - Innate risk tolerance shaping opportunity perception

**Audit questions:**
- What biases am I most susceptible to?
- What kinds of patterns do I notice easily vs. overlook?
- How does my risk disposition color what I see as opportunity vs. threat?

### 2. Cultural Traditions
The inherited frameworks from your environment:
- **Industry assumptions** - "That's how things work in this industry"
- **Professional training** - Frameworks drilled into you (MBA thinking, engineering thinking)
- **Organizational culture** - "How we do things here"

**Audit questions:**
- What industry "truths" have I absorbed without questioning?
- What professional frameworks am I applying automatically?
- What does my organization believe that might not be true?

### 3. Previous Experiences
Past successes and failures that shape current perception:
- **Success patterns** - "This worked before, so do it again"
- **Trauma avoidance** - "This failed before, never do it again"
- **Anchoring on memorable events** - Recent or vivid experiences weighted too heavily

**Audit questions:**
- What past success am I trying to repeat that may not apply here?
- What past failure am I avoiding that might be the right move now?
- What recent event is anchoring my thinking?

### 4. New Information
Current data flowing into the orientation process:
- **Information diet** - What sources am I consuming?
- **Signal vs. noise** - What am I treating as signal that might be noise?
- **Missing data** - What information am I not getting?

**Audit questions:**
- Where does my information come from? Who filters it?
- What signals am I treating as meaningful that might be random?
- What information would change my view that I'm not seeking?

### 5. Analysis/Synthesis Process
How you break down and reassemble understanding:
- **Destruction process** - How do you break apart existing models?
- **Creation process** - How do you synthesize new understanding?
- **Update frequency** - How often do you actually update orientation?

**Audit questions:**
- When did I last fundamentally question my framework?
- How do I synthesize new information into my worldview?
- What would it take to make me change my mind?

---

## The Orientation Validity Test

After examining the five factors, test orientation validity:

### Reality Alignment
- Do my predictions match outcomes?
- Am I consistently surprised by events?
- Do others with different orientations see things I miss?

### Adaptation Speed
- How quickly do I update when new information arrives?
- What beliefs have I held unchanged for too long?
- What should have changed my mind but didn't?

### Blind Spot Check
- What would my critics say I'm missing?
- What do people who disagree with me see?
- What am I certain about that I shouldn't be?

---

## Workflow

### Step 1: Gather and Review Inputs

Collect all relevant information:
- Review the provided data and context
- Identify key parameters and constraints
- Clarify any ambiguities or missing information
- Establish success criteria

### Step 2: Analyze the Situation

Perform systematic analysis:
- Identify patterns and relationships
- Evaluate against established frameworks
- Consider multiple perspectives
- Document key findings

### Step 3: Generate Recommendations

Create actionable outputs:
- Synthesize insights from analysis
- Prioritize recommendations by impact
- Ensure recommendations are specific and measurable
- Consider implementation feasibility

**Adaptation speed:** [Score: Fast/Moderate/Slow]
- Evidence: [How long stale beliefs persist]

**Blind spots identified:**
1. [Specific blind spot]

**Ongoing:**
- [Practice or process to maintain orientation accuracy]

**Warning signs to watch:**
- [Indicators that orientation is drifting from reality]

## Constraints

- Be ruthless about questioning comfortable assumptions
- Don't accept "that's just how it is" as justification
- Look for where past success is creating current blindness
- Acknowledge uncertainty - some orientation is unknowable
- Focus on what WOULD change orientation, not just what confirms it

## Example

**Input:** "I've been leading product at our SaaS company for 5 years. We're losing deals to a new competitor with what I think is an inferior product. Can you audit my orientation on this?"

**Output:**

## Orientation Audit

### Context Summary
A 5-year product leader facing unexpected competitive losses despite confidence in product superiority. The gap between expectation ("our product is better") and outcome ("we're losing deals") suggests orientation misalignment.

### Factor Analysis

#### Genetic Heritage
| Factor | Current State | Potential Distortion |
|--------|---------------|---------------------|
| Confirmation bias | High risk - 5 years building = emotional investment | Seeking evidence product is better, dismissing evidence it isn't |
| Pattern recognition | Trained on enterprise SaaS patterns | May miss new patterns (PLG, usage-based, community-led) |
| Risk disposition | Success breeds caution | Protecting existing product vs. disrupting self |

#### Cultural Traditions
| Inherited Belief | Source | Validity Check |
|-----------------|--------|----------------|
| "More features = better product" | Enterprise SaaS culture | Questionable - competitor may win on simplicity |
| "Enterprise deals require sales" | Industry standard | Questionable - PLG changing this |
| "We know our customers" | 5 years of conversations | Questionable - talking to CURRENT customers, not the ones leaving |

#### Previous Experiences
| Formative Experience | Current Influence | Still Valid? |
|---------------------|-------------------|--------------|
| Built product that won initially | Confidence in product judgment | May not apply - market moved |
| Enterprise sales motion worked | Defending current GTM | Market may have shifted |
| "Inferior" competitors failed before | Dismissing new competitor | Different competitor, different context |

#### New Information
| Information Source | Quality Assessment | Blind Spot Risk |
|-------------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| Customer success calls | Biased sample (happy customers) | Not hearing from churned/lost |
| Win/loss analysis | Often superficial or defensive | May not capture real reasons |
| Sales feedback | Filtered through their assumptions | May blame price not product |
| Competitor product reviews | Filtered through your definition of "good" | Missing what customers value |

#### Analysis/Synthesis
**Last fundamental update:** Unclear - may not have updated core beliefs in years
**Update trigger:** Unknown - what WOULD make you believe competitor is actually better?
**Synthesis method:** New data interpreted through "our product is better" lens

### Validity Assessment

**Reality alignment:** Weak
- Evidence: You're losing deals despite believing you shouldn't be. Predictions don't match outcomes.

**Adaptation speed:** Slow
- Evidence: 5 years with same framework, now facing unexpected losses

**Blind spots identified:**
1. **Feature blindness:** You evaluate on features; customers may evaluate on simplicity, speed-to-value, or price
2. **Survivor bias:** You talk to customers who chose you, not those who chose the competitor
3. **Definition of "better":** Your definition may not match the market's definition

### Reorientation Recommendations

**Immediate:**
- Interview 5 recent lost deals with genuine curiosity (not defensiveness)
- Use their product yourself for a real task - experience, don't evaluate
- Ask: "What would make me believe they're actually better?" Then look for that evidence.

**Ongoing:**
- Build a "red team" process that argues the competitor's case
- Track WHY deals are lost, not just that they're lost
- Spend time with prospects BEFORE they choose, not just customers AFTER

**Warning signs to watch:**
- Explaining away losses as "price" or "they don't get it"
- Increased confidence despite continued losses
- Team afraid to bring bad news about competition

### The Boyd Challenge
You say their product is inferior. You're losing deals. One of these is wrong. Here's the hard question: If you were starting fresh today with no history, would you build what you have or what they have? If you're honest, and the answer is "what they have" - then your orientation isn't just outdated, it's protecting your ego from the truth. What would it take for you to actually believe you need to change, not just acknowledge the possibility?

## Integration

This skill is part of the **John Boyd** expert persona. Use it when you suspect your mental models are leading you astray, or when reality keeps surprising you. Remember Boyd's insight: "Orientation is the schwerpunkt" - if your orientation is wrong, no amount of speed will save you.
