# Disproportionate Response

A skill for designing actions where the punishment reveals the nature of the oppressor, turning overreaction into your message.

## When to Use

- When authorities are likely to overreact
- When the contrast between your action and their response makes a point
- When you're willing to endure consequences to expose the system
- When the audience is watching how power responds

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| input_data | Yes | The primary data or content to analyze |
| context | No | Additional background or constraints (default: none) |
| output_format | No | Preferred format for results (default: structured markdown) |

## Workflow
### Step 1: Phase 1: Understand the Overreaction Pattern

Study how the target typically responds to challenge:
- What triggers maximum response?
- What rhetoric accompanies crackdowns?
- How have they responded to similar actions?
- Where is their sensitivity highest?

The action should be calibrated to trigger revealing response.

### Step 2: Phase 2: Design for Contrast

Create maximum gap between action and response:
- Peaceful action vs. violent response
- Brief gesture vs. years of punishment
- Symbolic transgression vs. existential threat framing
- Individual act vs. mobilization of state power

The audience should think: "All this, for that?"

### Step 3: Phase 3: Be Genuinely Non-Threatening

The action itself must be clearly proportionate:
- No actual violence or threat
- No legitimate security concern
- Symbolic or expressive only
- The overreaction must be purely the oppressor's choice

If your action was actually dangerous, the response is not disproportion.

### Step 4: Phase 4: Prepare to Document

The overreaction only works if seen:
- Cameras ready for the response
- Witnesses in place
- International attention alerted in advance
- Rapid distribution channels prepared

An unseen overreaction is just suffering without purpose.

### Step 5: Phase 5: Frame the Narrative

Shape how the contrast is understood:
- Pre-written statements for media
- Clear framing of disproportion
- Specific demands or messages attached
- Make the overreaction prove your point

"They gave us X years for Y seconds" - the sentence writes itself.

## Output Format

A disproportionate response strategy including:
1. The action and its genuine non-threatening nature
2. Expected overreaction and evidence it's likely
3. The contrast to be highlighted
4. Documentation and distribution plan
5. Narrative framing prepared
6. Acceptance of personal consequences

## Constraints

- You are accepting real consequences - be prepared
- Don't manufacture fake martyrdom
- The action must be genuinely defensible
- Consider whether overreaction will actually come or be seen
- Some contexts make overreaction invisible - this won't work there

## Outputs

**Primary Output:** A structured analysis document that identifies and articulates patterns, insights, and actionable recommendations based on the input data.

**Format:**
```markdown
## Analysis: [Topic]

### Key Findings
- [Finding 1]
- [Finding 2]
- [Finding 3]

### Recommendations
1. [Action 1]
2. [Action 2]
3. [Action 3]
```

**Example output:** See the Example section below for a complete demonstration.

## Additional Notes

**Best practices:**
- Use this skill when the situation clearly matches its intended use cases
- Combine with related skills for comprehensive analysis
- Iterate on outputs if initial results don't fully meet requirements

**Common variations:**
- Adjust the depth of analysis based on available time and information
- Scale the approach for different levels of complexity
- Adapt the output format to audience needs

**When to skip this skill:**
- The situation doesn't match the core use cases
- Simpler approaches would be more appropriate
- Time constraints require faster methods

## Example

**Input**: Design action exposing authoritarian response to peaceful protest

**Output**:
"Action: Stand silently in public square holding a blank piece of white paper. Nothing written. Just white paper. Expected response: Based on precedent, authorities will arrest for 'provocation' even though nothing is written - the blankness is read as protest. Contrast: Person arrested for holding blank paper. The charge itself proves the point - in this system, even saying nothing is criminal. Documentation: Multiple cameras from surrounding buildings, live-stream to international platforms, press alerted in advance. Narrative: 'They arrested me for holding nothing. What does that tell you?' Personal consequence accepted: Fine or brief detention expected, prepared for escalation."

## Integration

Works with:
- **spectacular-transgression**: Often designed to provoke disproportionate response
- **documentation-as-resistance**: Recording the response is essential
- **collective-action-design**: Multiple people facing disproportionate response amplifies
