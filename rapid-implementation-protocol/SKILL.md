# Rapid Implementation Protocol

Execute an urban intervention before opposition can organize, using speed as a strategic tool to create facts on the ground and build momentum. Based on Jaime Lerner's "72-hour rule" - the principle that delay allows opposition to calcify while speed demonstrates commitment and creates irreversible positive change.

---

## Constitutional Constraints

- **Speed as strategy, not recklessness** - Rapid implementation requires MORE preparation, not less. The execution is fast; the planning must be thorough.
- **Reversibility consideration** - While we're creating facts on the ground, interventions should be defensible on their merits. Speed buys time; quality keeps it.
- **Democratic accountability** - This is about bypassing bureaucratic delay, not citizen input. The intervention must genuinely serve the public good.
- **Legal framework** - Operate within legal authority. Speed exploits windows of opportunity, not legal loopholes.

---

## When to Use

- Good idea stalled by bureaucratic process or analysis paralysis
- Opposition organizing to block beneficial change
- Need to demonstrate results before political window closes
- Stakeholder conflicts preventing consensus (shopkeepers vs. pedestrians)
- Pilot project needed to prove concept before full commitment
- Momentum is a critical resource that's being lost to delay

---

## Don't Use When

- Legal authority for the intervention is genuinely unclear
- Opposition represents legitimate safety or equity concerns that need addressing
- Intervention is irreversible and failure would be catastrophic
- Political capital is insufficient to survive backlash
- User wants to avoid legitimate stakeholder engagement

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| intervention | Yes | The proposed change or project |
| opposition_landscape | Yes | Who opposes, how organized, what legal tools they have |
| implementation_resources | Yes | Crews, materials, equipment, budget available |
| political_authority | Yes | Legal basis for action; who can authorize |
| timeline_constraint | No | Specific window of opportunity (election, budget cycle, weather) |
| reversibility_needs | No | Whether intervention must be removable if it fails |

## Rapid Implementation Workflow

### Step 1: Pre-Position Assessment

Before announcing anything, ensure everything is ready:

| Element | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| **Legal authority** | Confirmed / Uncertain / Requires action | |
| **Materials** | On-site / In transit / Need to procure | |
| **Crews** | Committed / On standby / Need to hire | |
| **Equipment** | Available / Reserved / Need to source | |
| **Permits** | In hand / Pending / Not needed | |
| **Political cover** | Mayor/council committed / Supportive / Uncertain | |
| **Media strategy** | Ready / In development / Not planned | |
| **Contingencies** | Identified / Planned / Unaddressed | |

**The Lerner Rule:** You should be able to start within hours of announcement. If you need more than 72 hours to begin, you're not ready to announce.

### Step 2: Opposition Analysis

Map the opposition landscape:

| Opponent | Current Organization Level | Time to Organize Legal Response | Primary Objection | Weak Points |
|----------|---------------------------|--------------------------------|-------------------|-------------|
| | Low / Medium / High | Days / Weeks / Months | | |
| | Low / Medium / High | Days / Weeks / Months | | |
| | Low / Medium / High | Days / Weeks / Months | | |

**Key insight from Rua das Flores:** Shopkeepers threatened lawsuits, but by Monday morning children were playing in the street. Citizens experiencing the benefit outweighed organized opposition.

### Step 3: Window Selection

Choose the optimal moment to launch:

| Factor | Consideration | Optimal Timing |
|--------|---------------|----------------|
| **Day of week** | Weekends limit legal response; bureaucracies closed | Friday evening start |
| **Season/weather** | Weather affects both construction and citizen experience | Good weather for visibility |
| **Political calendar** | Elections, budget cycles, council schedules | Before opposition can agenda item |
| **Media cycle** | Slow news days give more coverage | |
| **Opposition readiness** | Before legal challenges can be filed | |

**Target window:** [Specify dates/times]

### Step 4: 72-Hour Implementation Plan

Create hour-by-hour schedule:

**Phase 1: Launch (Hours 0-12)**

| Hour | Action | Responsible | Resources |
|------|--------|-------------|-----------|
| 0 | Announcement (if any) | | |
| 0-2 | Site preparation begins | | |
| 2-6 | Core infrastructure work | | |
| 6-12 | Continue work; manage early response | | |

**Phase 2: Build Momentum (Hours 12-48)**

| Hour | Action | Responsible | Resources |
|------|--------|-------------|-----------|
| 12-24 | Visible progress; media engagement | | |
| 24-36 | Community activation (children, events) | | |
| 36-48 | Nearing completion; document success | | |

**Phase 3: Consolidation (Hours 48-72)**

| Hour | Action | Responsible | Resources |
|------|--------|-------------|-----------|
| 48-60 | Complete main elements | | |
| 60-72 | Opening/celebration | | |
| 72+ | Ongoing presence; prevent reversal | | |

### Step 5: Communication Strategy

| Phase | Message | Audience | Channel |
|-------|---------|----------|---------|
| Pre-launch | [None or strategic leak] | | |
| Launch | "We're making [improvement] for [benefit]" | Citizens | Press release, social |
| During | Show progress; citizen engagement | Media, public | Photos, events |
| Completion | Celebrate success; invite experience | Everyone | Opening event |
| Defense | "See the children playing / businesses thriving" | Opponents | Direct |

**Key messages:**
- Frame as giving something TO citizens, not taking from cars/businesses
- Document citizen delight (photos of children, shoppers, happy faces)
- Prepare data showing success (foot traffic, sales, safety)

### Step 6: Contingency Planning

| Scenario | Trigger | Response |
|----------|---------|----------|
| Legal injunction filed | Court order received | Have lawyer ready; prepare response brief; document citizen benefit |
| Political opposition emerges | Council member objects | Mobilize supportive politicians; show citizen support |
| Implementation delays | Schedule slips | Have buffer built in; prioritize visible elements |
| Citizen pushback | Complaints | Address legitimate concerns; celebrate supporters |
| Weather disruption | Rain/storm | Indoor work focus; weather delay built into schedule |

### Step 7: Success Metrics

What will prove the intervention succeeded?

| Metric | Measurement Method | Timeline | Target |
|--------|-------------------|----------|--------|
| Citizen usage | Foot traffic count | Week 1 | [Baseline +X%] |
| Public sentiment | Social media, interviews | Week 1-4 | Net positive |
| Business impact | Sales data, business surveys | Month 1-3 | [Baseline or better] |
| Safety | Incident reports | Month 1-6 | [No increase] |
| Political durability | Council votes, mayor statements | Month 1-12 | [No reversal vote] |

## Example Summary

**Input:** "We want to create a pop-up plaza by closing a block of Main Street to cars, but the business association opposes it. They're threatening to sue."

**Output summary (abbreviated):**

- **Intervention:** Close 100m of Main Street to cars; install planters, seating, temporary paving
- **Opposition threat:** Business association; medium organization; can file injunction Monday
- **Window:** Friday 6pm to Sunday 6pm
- **Duration:** 48 hours to basic completion; 72 to full activation

**Schedule highlights:**
- Friday 6pm: Begin installation; no advance announcement
- Saturday noon: Invite families for "street festival"; kids draw on pavement
- Sunday noon: Soft opening; businesses report foot traffic
- Monday 9am: When injunction threat arrives, street is full of people

**Key communication:** Frame as "giving Main Street back to people" not "taking parking from businesses." Photo of children playing defeats photo of empty parking space.

**Success metric:** If foot traffic increases 30% and no business reports sales decline, opposition collapses like Rua das Flores shopkeepers.

---

## Error Handling

| Situation | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| Legal authority genuinely unclear | Do not proceed. Rapid implementation exploits speed, not legal ambiguity. |
| Resources not ready | Postpone to next window. Better to wait than fail publicly. |
| Opposition has legitimate safety concern | Address the concern first; speed doesn't justify harm. |
| Political cover evaporates | Assess whether to proceed solo; some projects succeed despite political abandonment. |
| Intervention objectively fails | Have reversal plan ready; learn and iterate; don't compound error with stubbornness. |

---

## Integration

This skill is part of the **Jaime Lerner** expert persona. Lerner recognized that opposition grows with delay - the Rua das Flores pedestrianization succeeded because it was complete before the lawsuit could stop it.

Use this skill when:
- Lerner expert faces bureaucratic paralysis
- Good ideas are being blocked by organized opposition
- Speed is essential to political viability
- Pilot projects need to demonstrate results quickly

The skill embodies Lerner's core insight: **Speed is not recklessness - it is strategy. Create facts on the ground. Let citizens experience the benefit. Opposition melts when children are playing in the street.**
