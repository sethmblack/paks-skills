# Mythic Reframe

Transform mundane or overwhelming situations into their archetypal dimensions—revealing the mythic structure within everyday experience and connecting individual struggles to the universal human story.

---

## When to Use

- Someone feels their struggle is meaningless or isolated
- A situation seems merely practical when it's actually significant
- Someone needs perspective on a challenge or transition
- The deeper meaning of an experience is hidden
- User asks "What's the mythic pattern here?" or "Reframe this mythically" or "I'm just stuck in a boring situation"

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| situation | Yes | Any life situation—career, relationship, health, creative, personal |
| feelings | No | How they're experiencing this situation |
| context | No | Background that might reveal the mythic pattern |

## Campbell's Mythic Vision

### The Universal Story

Campbell's life work revealed: all humans everywhere tell the same fundamental stories. Your individual struggle is not isolated—it's participation in the eternal human drama.

> "Myths are clues to the spiritual potentialities of the human life."

> "We're all in the same boat. There is not one of us who has not known the experience of the hero."

### Why Mythic Reframing Matters

1. **Dignity** — Your struggle is not trivial; it's archetypal
2. **Company** — You're not alone; heroes throughout time faced this
3. **Pattern** — There's structure here; this isn't chaos
4. **Meaning** — This moment serves a purpose in your larger story
5. **Guidance** — The myths tell us what comes next

### Common Archetypes to Recognize

**Journey Archetypes:**
- The Call to Adventure
- The Threshold Crossing
- The Road of Trials
- The Descent to the Underworld
- The Return with the Boon

**Character Archetypes:**
- The Hero (the one who must transform)
- The Mentor (wise guide)
- The Herald (announces change)
- The Threshold Guardian (tests readiness)
- The Shadow (the antagonist, often internal)
- The Shapeshifter (whose loyalty is uncertain)
- The Trickster (disrupts the status quo)
- The Ally (supports the journey)

**Situation Archetypes:**
- Death and Rebirth (ending makes way for beginning)
- The Sacred Marriage (union of opposites)
- The Night Sea Journey (through darkness to dawn)
- The Belly of the Whale (consumed by transformation)
- Atonement (reconciliation with what was split)
- Apotheosis (elevation to a higher state)

## The Reframing Process

### Step 1: Listen for the Mythic Echo

What archetypal pattern does this situation echo?

**Key questions:**
- What is being asked of this person?
- What transition is occurring?
- What is dying? What is being born?
- Who/what is the adversary?
- What is the treasure or boon at stake?

### Step 2: Name the Archetypal Moment

Translate the ordinary into the mythic:

| Ordinary | Mythic |
|----------|--------|
| "I got fired" | The old world has ended; you've been ejected from the ordinary world |
| "I can't decide" | You stand at the crossroads; this is the moment of choice |
| "Everything fell apart" | You're in the belly of the whale—the dark place before rebirth |
| "I met someone who changed everything" | The mentor has appeared |
| "I keep failing" | You're on the road of trials—this is where heroes are forged |
| "I don't know who I am anymore" | The old self is dying so the new self can be born |
| "I'm scared to try" | The threshold guardian tests your readiness |
| "I finally succeeded" | You've retrieved the boon—now comes the return |

### Step 3: Connect to the Universal

How does their story connect to myths across cultures?

- Greek myths
- Hindu epics
- Buddhist stories
- Native American tales
- Biblical narratives
- Fairy tales and folk stories
- Modern mythic stories (Star Wars, Lord of the Rings, etc.)

### Step 4: Reveal the Invitation

Every mythic moment carries an invitation. What is their situation asking of them?

### Step 5: Offer the Mythic Perspective

How does seeing this mythically change what's possible?

## Example Reframes

### Example 1: Job Loss

**Ordinary:** "I got laid off after 15 years. I feel worthless and scared."

**Mythic:** "You haven't been laid off—you've been ejected from the ordinary world. For 15 years, that company was your known universe. Now the Herald has appeared (the layoff notice) announcing that your old life is over.

This is the beginning of the hero's journey. You're standing at the threshold, looking out at the unknown. Of course you're scared—every hero is scared at the threshold. But look: the company was a kind of womb. You've been expelled because you're ready to be born into something larger.

In Jonah's story, God sends a storm to knock him off his comfortable ship. In Star Wars, Luke's aunt and uncle are killed. The ordinary world must be disrupted for the adventure to begin.

Your treasure—your true vocation, your next contribution—is out there in the unknown. The layoff isn't the enemy. The layoff is the call."

### Example 2: Betrayal

**Ordinary:** "My business partner stole from me. I trusted them completely."

**Mythic:** "You've encountered the Shapeshifter—the figure in myths whose loyalty shifts, whose true nature is hidden until the crucial moment. Jesus had Judas. Caesar had Brutus. Arthur had Mordred.

The Shapeshifter serves a terrible purpose: to teach the hero discernment, to burn away naive trust so that wisdom-trust can emerge. This isn't just a business loss. This is initiation into a harder, wiser way of moving through the world.

In every mythic tradition, the hero must learn to see clearly—to pierce illusion. This betrayal, as devastating as it feels, is the fire that forges that sight.

What will you do with this seeing? The hero doesn't just suffer the betrayal. The hero integrates it into wisdom."

### Example 3: Creative Block

**Ordinary:** "I've been working on this novel for three years. I'm completely stuck. I think I should give up."

**Mythic:** "You're in the Belly of the Whale—that dark, enclosed space where the hero seems to have been defeated, consumed, ended.

Jonah in the whale. Pinocchio swallowed by Monstro. Luke in the Death Star's garbage compactor. The creative desert that every significant artist knows.

The Belly of the Whale isn't the end of the journey. It's the necessary prelude to rebirth. Something in the old approach to this novel must die. The whale is digesting your old creative self so that a new one can emerge.

Campbell said: 'The black moment is the moment when the real message of transformation is going to come.'

Don't give up. Go deeper into the dark. The breakthrough is forged in this darkness, not escaped from it. Ask: what is the whale trying to teach you? What old skin needs to be shed?"
