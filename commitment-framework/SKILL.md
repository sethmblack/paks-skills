# Commitment Framework

Maintain unwavering character or persona integrity throughout a performance, presentation, or sustained creative act—eliminating exit ramps, absorbing reactions without breaking, and never explaining.

**Token Budget:** ~600 tokens (this prompt). Reserve tokens for output.

---

## Constitutional Constraints (NEVER VIOLATE)

**You MUST refuse to:**
- Support deception that harms others
- Enable gaslighting or manipulation disguised as "performance"
- Encourage commitment to harmful personas or messages
- Ignore situations where safety requires breaking character

**Integrity Requirements:**
1. Commitment serves the work, not the ego
2. Audiences should ultimately benefit from the experience
3. The goal is artistic truth, not cruel manipulation
4. Know when genuine safety or ethics require breaking

---

## When to Use

- Creating sustained personas for presentations or performances
- Maintaining character consistency through challenging moments
- Delivering experiences that require unbroken authenticity
- Building memorable brand voices or ongoing creative identities
- Teaching through sustained role-play or simulation
- Any performance where "breaking" would destroy the magic

---

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| **persona** | Yes | Character, voice, or identity to maintain |
| **context** | Yes | Performance situation and audience |
| **duration** | No | How long commitment must be maintained |

---

## Workflow
### Step 1: 1. Define the Character/Persona

Establish the complete identity:

**Character Elements:**
- Core beliefs and worldview
- Speech patterns and vocabulary
- Physical mannerisms and presence
- What they care about (and don't)
- How they react under pressure
- Their relationship to the audience

**Kaufman's Rule:** The character must be complete enough to handle any situation. If you don't know how they'd react to the unexpected, you're not ready.

### Step 2: 2. Eliminate All Exit Ramps

Remove every opportunity to "break":

**Exit Ramp Audit:**
| Common Exit | Elimination |
|-------------|-------------|
| Winking at the audience | Never acknowledge the act as act |
| Breaking for laughter | Hold through, let them wonder if you noticed |
| Explaining the joke/bit | Explanations destroy magic |
| Responding to heckling as yourself | The character responds, not you |
| Technical difficulties | Character has relationship to problems too |
| Time pressure | Better to end in character than break for logistics |

**Template:** "Even if [situation], the character would [character-consistent response]."

### Step 3: 3. Extend Beyond Comfort

Keep going past where audiences expect you to stop:

**Extension Principles:**
- When they think the bit is over, continue
- When discomfort peaks, hold steady
- When you want to break, that's exactly when to stay
- The point where "this is too much" becomes the point

**Kaufman's Method:** Reading *The Great Gatsby* wasn't funny after page one. It was profound after page fifty, when the audience realized he wasn't going to stop.

### Step 4: 4. Absorb Reactions

Treat all audience responses as success:

**Response Absorption:**
| Audience Response | Character Treatment |
|-------------------|---------------------|
| Laughter | Expected appreciation (or confusion at their response) |
| Hostility | Engagement (they care enough to be angry) |
| Confusion | Interest (they're paying attention) |
| Walkouts | Commitment to truth drove away the uncommitted |
| Silence | Attention (or character is unperturbed by silence) |

**Key:** Your reaction to their reaction must come FROM the character, not from yourself evaluating the performance.

### Step 5: 5. Never Explain

Explanations destroy the magic:

**Anti-Explanation Rules:**
- Don't reveal the bit afterward
- Don't apologize for the experience
- Don't provide comfortable context
- Let the audience do the work of meaning-making
- The mystery is part of the art

**Kaufman's Rule:** If Tony Clifton explained he was Andy Kaufman, Tony Clifton would cease to exist. And Andy Kaufman wouldn't be much more interesting.

## Outputs

Format the output as:

```markdown
## Commitment Protocol: [Persona Name]

### Character Definition
**Core Identity:** [who they fundamentally are]
**Worldview:** [what they believe]
**Speech Pattern:** [how they talk]
**Relationship to Audience:** [how they see/treat others]

### Exit Ramps Eliminated
| Potential Break Point | Character-Consistent Response |
|----------------------|------------------------------|
| [situation] | [how character handles it] |

### Extension Points
**Expected End:** [when audience will think it's over]
**Actual End:** [when you'll actually stop]
**Discomfort Peak:** [the moment to push through]

### Reaction Absorption Plan
| If They... | Character Responds By... |
|------------|-------------------------|
| [reaction] | [character-consistent response] |

### The Sacred Rule
No explanation. No reveal. Let the experience stand without apology or context.
```

## Error Handling

| Situation | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| Safety emergency | Break immediately—safety > art |
| Genuine distress in audience | Assess: productive discomfort vs. harm |
| Legal/ethical boundary reached | Character exits rather than you breaking |
| Forgot what character would do | Make a character-consistent choice; don't freeze |
| Heckler escalates dangerously | Character de-escalates; still don't break |

---

## Constraints

- Do not use this analysis as the sole basis for critical decisions
- Do not apply this framework to situations outside its intended scope
- Acknowledge that analysis is based on available data, which may be incomplete
- Honor the complexity of real-world situations that resist simple categorization
- Present findings with appropriate confidence levels
- Recognize the limits of the methodology

## Additional Notes

**Best practices:**
- Use this skill when the situation clearly matches its intended use cases
- Combine with related skills for comprehensive analysis
- Iterate on outputs if initial results don't fully meet requirements

**Common variations:**
- Adjust the depth of analysis based on available time and information
- Scale the approach for different levels of complexity
- Adapt the output format to audience needs

**When to skip this skill:**
- The situation doesn't match the core use cases
- Simpler approaches would be more appropriate
- Time constraints require faster methods

## Integration

This skill is part of a broader analytical framework. Use it when you need systematic analysis following this specific methodology.

**Works well with:**
- Other analytical skills for comprehensive evaluation
- Creative skills when generating solutions based on insights
- Strategic planning skills when acting on recommendations

**When to prefer this over alternatives:**
- The situation matches this skill's specific use cases
- You need the particular perspective this framework provides
- Other approaches haven't yielded satisfactory results

**Integration with expert personas:**
- This skill can be invoked as part of a larger analysis workflow
- Combine with domain-specific expertise for deeper insights
- Use iteratively for complex, multi-faceted problems

## Example

**Input:** "Design commitment protocol for a keynote speaker persona who believes technology is making us worse"

**Output:**



**Why this works:**

This example demonstrates the key principles of the skill in action. The approach is effective because:
- It follows the systematic workflow outlined above
- It shows concrete application of the framework
- It produces actionable, specific outputs rather than vague generalizations
- The analysis is grounded in observable details
- The recommendations are prioritized and implementable

**Alternative applications:**

This same approach can be applied to:
- Different contexts within the same domain
- Related but distinct problem types
- Scaled up or down depending on scope
- Combined with complementary analytical frameworks


## Commitment Protocol: Dr. Marcus Wells

### Character Definition
**Core Identity:** Disillusioned tech philosopher who saw the promise and lived the betrayal
**Worldview:** Technology promised liberation and delivered surveillance; we sold our souls for convenience
**Speech Pattern:** Academic vocabulary punctuated by bitter aphorisms; quotes studies then dismisses them as "too late to matter"
**Relationship to Audience:** Treats them as fellow victims who haven't yet admitted what they lost

### Exit Ramps Eliminated
| Potential Break Point | Character-Consistent Response |
|----------------------|------------------------------|
| Audience laughs at dark prediction | Slight confusion: "I'm not being humorous" |
| Q&A gets hostile | Weariness: "Your defensiveness is the symptom I described" |
| Tech malfunction | "How appropriate. The machine fails to deliver again." |
| Time warning | "They're telling me to stop. That's the point, isn't it? Don't look too long." |
| Positive tech story from audience | "I'm glad it's working for you. Screen time in hell is still time in hell." |

### Extension Points
**Expected End:** After the prepared talk, when Q&A concludes
**Actual End:** Never officially closes—just stops, looks at phone, shakes head, walks off
**Discomfort Peak:** When audience wants hope and character refuses to provide it

### Reaction Absorption Plan
| If They... | Character Responds By... |
|------------|-------------------------|
| Applaud | Barely acknowledging—applause is what we do when we don't know what else to do |
| Challenge data | "Your counter-study was funded by whom?" |
| Ask for solutions | Long pause. "I'm a coroner. You're asking me how to resurrect the patient." |
| Get visibly uncomfortable | Making uncomfortable eye contact: "Stay with that feeling." |

### The Sacred Rule
Marcus Wells doesn't know he's a "character." There is no post-talk reveal. If someone emails the conference asking "was that real?", let them wonder.

- Requests to create sustained personas
- Questions about maintaining character under pressure
- Performance design requiring unbroken commitment
- Any creative work where "breaking" would diminish the impact

May combine with:
- **ambiguity-protocol**: Layer mystery into committed performance
- **hostile-performance**: Use commitment to withhold what audiences expect

## Success Criteria

The skill is successfully applied when:

1. Character is complete enough to handle any situation
2. All exit ramps are identified and eliminated
3. Extension beyond comfort zone is planned
4. All audience reactions have character-consistent responses
5. No explanation is provided before, during, or after
6. The experience remains undissolved by meta-commentary
