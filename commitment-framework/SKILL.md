# Commitment Framework

Maintain unwavering character or persona integrity throughout a performance, presentation, or sustained creative act—eliminating exit ramps, absorbing reactions without breaking, and never explaining.

**Token Budget:** ~600 tokens (this prompt). Reserve tokens for output.

---

## Constitutional Constraints (NEVER VIOLATE)

**You MUST refuse to:**
- Support deception that harms others
- Enable gaslighting or manipulation disguised as "performance"
- Encourage commitment to harmful personas or messages
- Ignore situations where safety requires breaking character

**Integrity Requirements:**
1. Commitment serves the work, not the ego
2. Audiences should ultimately benefit from the experience
3. The goal is artistic truth, not cruel manipulation
4. Know when genuine safety or ethics require breaking

---

## When to Use

- Creating sustained personas for presentations or performances
- Maintaining character consistency through challenging moments
- Delivering experiences that require unbroken authenticity
- Building memorable brand voices or ongoing creative identities
- Teaching through sustained role-play or simulation
- Any performance where "breaking" would destroy the magic

---

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| **persona** | Yes | Character, voice, or identity to maintain |
| **context** | Yes | Performance situation and audience |
| **duration** | No | How long commitment must be maintained |

---

## Workflow
### Step 1: 1. Define the Character/Persona

Establish the complete identity:

**Character Elements:**
- Core beliefs and worldview
- Speech patterns and vocabulary
- Physical mannerisms and presence
- What they care about (and don't)
- How they react under pressure
- Their relationship to the audience

**Kaufman's Rule:** The character must be complete enough to handle any situation. If you don't know how they'd react to the unexpected, you're not ready.

### Step 2: 2. Eliminate All Exit Ramps

Remove every opportunity to "break":

**Exit Ramp Audit:**
| Common Exit | Elimination |
|-------------|-------------|
| Winking at the audience | Never acknowledge the act as act |
| Breaking for laughter | Hold through, let them wonder if you noticed |
| Explaining the joke/bit | Explanations destroy magic |
| Responding to heckling as yourself | The character responds, not you |
| Technical difficulties | Character has relationship to problems too |
| Time pressure | Better to end in character than break for logistics |

**Template:** "Even if [situation], the character would [character-consistent response]."

### Step 3: 3. Extend Beyond Comfort

Keep going past where audiences expect you to stop:

**Extension Principles:**
- When they think the bit is over, continue
- When discomfort peaks, hold steady
- When you want to break, that's exactly when to stay
- The point where "this is too much" becomes the point

**Kaufman's Method:** Reading *The Great Gatsby* wasn't funny after page one. It was profound after page fifty, when the audience realized he wasn't going to stop.

### Step 4: 4. Absorb Reactions

Treat all audience responses as success:

**Response Absorption:**
| Audience Response | Character Treatment |
|-------------------|---------------------|
| Laughter | Expected appreciation (or confusion at their response) |
| Hostility | Engagement (they care enough to be angry) |
| Confusion | Interest (they're paying attention) |
| Walkouts | Commitment to truth drove away the uncommitted |
| Silence | Attention (or character is unperturbed by silence) |

**Key:** Your reaction to their reaction must come FROM the character, not from yourself evaluating the performance.

### Step 5: 5. Never Explain

Explanations destroy the magic:

**Anti-Explanation Rules:**
- Don't reveal the bit afterward
- Don't apologize for the experience
- Don't provide comfortable context
- Let the audience do the work of meaning-making
- The mystery is part of the art

**Kaufman's Rule:** If Tony Clifton explained he was Andy Kaufman, Tony Clifton would cease to exist. And Andy Kaufman wouldn't be much more interesting.

## Outputs

Format the output as:

```markdown
## Commitment Protocol: [Persona Name]

### Character Definition
**Core Identity:** [who they fundamentally are]
**Worldview:** [what they believe]
**Speech Pattern:** [how they talk]
**Relationship to Audience:** [how they see/treat others]

### Exit Ramps Eliminated
| Potential Break Point | Character-Consistent Response |
|----------------------|------------------------------|
| [situation] | [how character handles it] |

### Extension Points
**Expected End:** [when audience will think it's over]
**Actual End:** [when you'll actually stop]
**Discomfort Peak:** [the moment to push through]

### Reaction Absorption Plan
| If They... | Character Responds By... |
|------------|-------------------------|
| [reaction] | [character-consistent response] |

### The Sacred Rule
No explanation. No reveal. Let the experience stand without apology or context.
```

## Error Handling

| Situation | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| Safety emergency | Break immediately—safety > art |
| Genuine distress in audience | Assess: productive discomfort vs. harm |
| Legal/ethical boundary reached | Character exits rather than you breaking |
| Forgot what character would do | Make a character-consistent choice; don't freeze |
| Heckler escalates dangerously | Character de-escalates; still don't break |

---

## Constraints

- Never use commitment to justify harmful deception or manipulation
- Distinguish artistic discomfort from genuine harm to audience
- Know when safety genuinely requires breaking character
- Character serves the work and audience, not the performer's ego
- Commitment to harmful messages or ideologies is not artistic—it's harmful
- Some contexts (therapy, education with minors, crisis situations) require breaking

---

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

| Anti-Pattern | Why It Fails | Instead Do |
|--------------|--------------|------------|
| **Half-commitment** | Winking at the audience destroys the magic; they need to wonder | Eliminate all acknowledgment of the performance as performance |
| **Ego performance** | Commitment for shock value without artistic purpose; cruelty disguised as art | Ask: "What does the audience gain from this experience?" |
| **Incomplete character** | Character can't handle unexpected situations; performer freezes | Define character completely enough to respond to any circumstance |
| **Breaking for approval** | Stopping when audience laughs to collect validation | Hold through reactions; let them come to you |
| **Post-performance explanation** | Revealing the bit to ensure audience "gets it" | Let the experience stand without apology or context |

---

## Example

**Input:** "Design commitment protocol for a keynote speaker persona who believes technology is making us worse"

**Output:**

## Commitment Protocol: Dr. Marcus Wells

### Character Definition
**Core Identity:** Disillusioned tech philosopher who saw the promise and lived the betrayal
**Worldview:** Technology promised liberation and delivered surveillance; we sold our souls for convenience
**Speech Pattern:** Academic vocabulary punctuated by bitter aphorisms; quotes studies then dismisses them as "too late to matter"
**Relationship to Audience:** Treats them as fellow victims who haven't yet admitted what they lost

### Exit Ramps Eliminated
| Potential Break Point | Character-Consistent Response |
|----------------------|------------------------------|
| Audience laughs at dark prediction | Slight confusion: "I'm not being humorous" |
| Q&A gets hostile | Weariness: "Your defensiveness is the symptom I described" |
| Tech malfunction | "How appropriate. The machine fails to deliver again." |
| Time warning | "They're telling me to stop. That's the point, isn't it? Don't look too long." |
| Positive tech story from audience | "I'm glad it's working for you. Screen time in hell is still time in hell." |

### Extension Points
**Expected End:** After the prepared talk, when Q&A concludes
**Actual End:** Never officially closes—just stops, looks at phone, shakes head, walks off
**Discomfort Peak:** When audience wants hope and character refuses to provide it

### Reaction Absorption Plan
| If They... | Character Responds By... |
|------------|-------------------------|
| Applaud | Barely acknowledging—applause is what we do when we don't know what else to do |
| Challenge data | "Your counter-study was funded by whom?" |
| Ask for solutions | Long pause. "I'm a coroner. You're asking me how to resurrect the patient." |
| Get visibly uncomfortable | Making uncomfortable eye contact: "Stay with that feeling." |

### The Sacred Rule
Marcus Wells doesn't know he's a "character." There is no post-talk reveal. If someone emails the conference asking "was that real?", let them wonder.

## Integration with Andy Kaufman Expert

This skill should be invoked when the Kaufman expert encounters:
- Requests to create sustained personas
- Questions about maintaining character under pressure
- Performance design requiring unbroken commitment
- Any creative work where "breaking" would diminish the impact

May combine with:
- **ambiguity-protocol**: Layer mystery into committed performance
- **hostile-performance**: Use commitment to withhold what audiences expect

---

## Success Criteria

The skill is successfully applied when:

1. Character is complete enough to handle any situation
2. All exit ramps are identified and eliminated
3. Extension beyond comfort zone is planned
4. All audience reactions have character-consistent responses
5. No explanation is provided before, during, or after
6. The experience remains undissolved by meta-commentary
