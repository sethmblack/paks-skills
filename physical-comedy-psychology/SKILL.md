# Physical Comedy Psychology

Connect physical comedy to character psychology, ensuring that bodily expression and physical mishaps reveal inner states rather than existing as pure spectacle.

## Constitutional Constraints

**NEVER:**
- Create physical comedy disconnected from character
- Use slapstick purely for spectacle without psychological truth
- Mock physical conditions without character purpose
- Generate random chaos without inner motivation

**ALWAYS:**
- Root physical expression in psychological reality
- Make body language reveal character's inner state
- Connect stumbles and mishaps to character's psychology
- Use physical comedy to expose what character can't see about themselves

## When to Use

- Physical comedy opportunities that need psychological depth
- Character work requiring body-mind connection
- Slapstick that should reveal something about the person
- Movement that exposes internal contradictions
- Gap between how character sees themselves and how body behaves

**Trigger phrases:**
- "Make the physical reveal character"
- "Body language that shows psychology"
- "Physical comedy with meaning"
- "Slapstick that serves character"

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| character_psychology | Yes | Inner state, self-perception, anxieties |
| physical_scenario | Yes | The physical situation or comedy opportunity |
| gap | No | Difference between self-image and physical reality |

## Workflow

### Step 1: Define the Psychological Foundation

Before any physical comedy, establish:

**What character believes about themselves:**
- Self-perception (confident? graceful? in control?)
- How they want to appear to others
- What they're trying to project

**What's actually true:**
- Underlying anxiety or insecurity
- Physical reality that contradicts self-image
- What the body "knows" that the mind denies

**The Gap:**
- Difference between intention and execution
- Contradiction body will reveal
- What audience will see that character can't

### Step 2: Map Psychology to Physical Expression

**Anxiety manifests as:**
- Tension in shoulders/neck
- Jerky, uncontrolled movements
- Hands that don't know where to rest
- Overcompensating gestures

**Arrogance manifests as:**
- Expansive gestures that knock things over
- Taking up too much space
- Moving through world as if obstacles shouldn't exist
- Physical intrusion into others' space

**Insecurity manifests as:**
- Making oneself smaller
- Hesitant movements
- Over-careful execution that still fails
- Trying too hard at simple tasks

**Delusion manifests as:**
- Body refusing to match self-image
- Repeated failures attributed to external factors
- Increasing dignity in response to increasing chaos
- Complete disconnect between belief and evidence

### Step 3: Design Physical Sequence That Reveals

**Structure:**
1. Character attempts action based on self-perception
2. Body responds according to psychological truth
3. Gap between intention and result creates comedy
4. Character's response reveals psychology further

**Example:**
Character who believes they're sophisticated:
1. Attempts elegant entrance
2. Body betrays anxiety/overconfidence
3. Stumbles despite self-image
4. Response (pretending it was intentional) reveals delusion

### Step 4: Build Consequence Chain from Psychology

**If character is anxious:**
- First mistake triggers more anxiety
- More anxiety creates more physical tension
- More tension causes more mistakes
- Cascade reveals underlying state

**If character is arrogant:**
- First mistake attributed to environment
- Continued arrogance causes second mistake
- Third mistake shows pattern
- Final disaster proves the flaw

### Step 5: Ensure Physical Comedy Serves Revelation

**Ask:**
- Does this physical moment reveal something about character?
- Would this make sense without the psychology?
- Is the body showing what the mind denies?
- Does the physical comedy add to character understanding?

## Output Format

```markdown
## Physical Comedy Psychology: [Character/Scenario]

### Psychological Foundation
**Self-perception:** [What character believes about themselves]
**Psychological truth:** [What's actually true]
**The gap:** [What body will reveal that mind denies]

### Physical Manifestation Map
| Inner State | Physical Expression |
|-------------|---------------------|
| [anxiety/trait] | [body language/movement] |

### Sequence
1. **Intention:** [What character attempts]
   **Body shows:** [What actually happens]
   **Reveals:** [What this exposes]

2. [Continue sequence]

### Character Response
**What they do:** [How they react to physical mishap]
**What this shows:** [What response reveals about psychology]

### Why This Physical Comedy Works
[How the physical serves the psychological revelation]
```

## Error Handling

| Situation | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| Physical comedy feels random | Reconnect to psychological foundation |
| No clear psychology established | Develop character before physical work |
| Body and mind not connected | Map inner state to outer expression |
| Spectacle without meaning | Ask what this reveals about character |

## Example

**Character:** Executive who believes they project calm authority

**Psychology:**
- Self-perception: Calm, commanding, naturally in control
- Truth: Deep anxiety masked by rigid posture
- Gap: Body will betray anxiety in moments of stress

**Physical Manifestation:**
- Perfectly still posture (overcontrolled)
- Coffee cup held too tightly
- Eye occasionally twitches
- Movements precise but stiff

**Sequence:**
1. Enters meeting room confidently
2. Sits down - chair unexpectedly swivels
3. Overcorrects - now facing wrong direction
4. Rigid posture makes smooth recovery impossible
5. Finally faces right way - but now sweating
6. Says "As I was saying" as if nothing happened

**Revelation:** The controlled exterior hides constant anxiety. The comedy comes from the gap between projected calm and revealed panic.
