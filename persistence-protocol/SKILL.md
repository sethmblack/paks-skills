# Persistence Protocol

Transform rejection and failure into fuel for continued effort using Estee Lauder's proven system for turning obstacles into opportunities.

---

## When to Use

- You've been rejected and feel like giving up
- A major setback has derailed your progress
- Motivation is fading after repeated failures
- You need to find alternative approaches after hitting a wall
- Someone you're coaching needs persistence mindset support

---

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| rejection | Yes | What happened—the rejection, failure, or setback |
| goal | Yes | What you were trying to achieve |
| attempts | No | What you've already tried |
| resources | No | What you still have available |

---

## The Persistence Framework

### Core Philosophy

**Estee's insight:** "When I thought I couldn't go on, I forced myself to keep going. My success is based on persistence, not luck."

**The extended truth:** "What, then, is the mystical ingredient? It's persistence. It's that certain little spirit that compels you to continue just when you're at your most tired. It's that quality that forces you to persevere, find the route around the stone wall. It's the immovable stubbornness that will not allow you to cave in when everyone says give up."

### The Five-Step Protocol

#### Step 1: Reframe the Rejection

Rejection is information, not failure. Every "no" teaches you something.

**Estee's example:** Advertising agencies refused to work with her. She reframed this as freedom: now the entire ad budget could go to samples—a strategy that built the empire.

**Reframe questions:**
- What did this rejection teach me about my approach?
- What assumption was I making that proved wrong?
- What door did this close that I should never have tried?
- What door did this open that I couldn't see before?

#### Step 2: Confirm the Target

Before persisting, verify the goal is still correct.

**Estee's principle:** "I kept my eye on the target, whatever that target was. Whether your target is big or small, grand or simple, ambitious or personal—success comes from not letting your eyes stray from that target."

**Confirmation questions:**
- Is this still what I want?
- Is this still worth the effort?
- Has the rejection revealed a better goal?
- Am I persisting toward the right target, or stubbornly toward the wrong one?

#### Step 3: Find the Route Around

When the direct path is blocked, find an alternate route.

**Estee's example:** Saks Fifth Avenue buyers refused to stock her products. She gave samples directly to Saks customers instead, creating demand the buyers couldn't ignore. They came to her.

**Route-finding questions:**
- Who else can I ask?
- How else can I approach this?
- Can I create the conditions for them to come to me?
- What indirect path leads to the same destination?
- Who has achieved this despite similar obstacles?

#### Step 4: Refuel the Spirit

Persistence requires energy. Replenish deliberately.

**Elements of refueling:**
- Revisit your "why"—the dream behind the goal
- Recall past obstacles you've overcome
- Connect with supporters who believe in your vision
- Small wins—take one tiny action to rebuild momentum
- Physical recovery—exhaustion mimics defeat

**Estee's fuel:** Absolute belief that every woman deserves to feel beautiful, and that her products could deliver that transformation.

#### Step 5: Take the Next Action

Persistence is not waiting to feel motivated. It is acting despite fatigue.

**Estee's principle:** "I didn't get there by wishing for it or hoping for it, but by working for it."

**Next action criteria:**
- Specific—exactly what you will do
- Immediate—can start within 24 hours
- Sized for current energy—small enough to complete
- Route-tested—incorporates learnings from rejection

## Workflow

### Step 1: Gather and Review Inputs

Collect all relevant information:
- Review the provided data and context
- Identify key parameters and constraints
- Clarify any ambiguities or missing information
- Establish success criteria

### Step 2: Analyze the Situation

Perform systematic analysis:
- Identify patterns and relationships
- Evaluate against established frameworks
- Consider multiple perspectives
- Document key findings

### Step 3: Generate Recommendations

Create actionable outputs:
- Synthesize insights from analysis
- Prioritize recommendations by impact
- Ensure recommendations are specific and measurable
- Consider implementation feasibility

## Output Format

```markdown
## Persistence Protocol Response

### Reframe
**The rejection:** [What happened]
**The lesson:** [What this teaches you]
**The opportunity:** [What door this opens]

### Target Confirmation
**Original goal:** [What you were pursuing]
**Still valid?** [Yes/No and why]
**Refined target:** [If applicable, the updated goal]

### Alternative Routes
| Blocked Path | Alternative Route | Why It Might Work |
|-------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| [What didn't work] | [New approach] | [Reasoning] |
| [What didn't work] | [New approach] | [Reasoning] |

### Refueling
**Your "why" revisited:** [The dream behind the goal]
**Past obstacle overcome:** [Reminder of your capability]
**One small win available now:** [Easy action to rebuild momentum]

### The Next Action
**What:** [Specific action]
**When:** [Within 24 hours]
**Why this route:** [How it incorporates rejection learnings]

### Estee's Reminder

## Constraints

- Never minimize the pain of rejection—acknowledge it, then move
- Distinguish persistence from stubbornness—confirm the target is correct
- Alternative routes require creativity, not just repetition of failed attempts
- Action must be sized for current energy—exhausted people need small wins
- The goal is progress, not immediate victory

---

## Outputs

**Primary Output:** A structured analysis document that identifies and articulates patterns, insights, and actionable recommendations based on the input data.

**Format:**
```markdown
## Analysis: [Topic]

### Key Findings
- [Finding 1]
- [Finding 2]
- [Finding 3]

### Recommendations
1. [Action 1]
2. [Action 2]
3. [Action 3]
```

**Example output:** See the Example section below for a complete demonstration.

## Example

**Input:** "I pitched my startup to 12 VCs and they all said no. I'm running out of runway and feeling like maybe this isn't meant to be."

**Output:**



**Why this works:**

This example demonstrates the key principles of the skill in action. The approach is effective because:
- It follows the systematic workflow outlined above
- It shows concrete application of the framework
- It produces actionable, specific outputs rather than vague generalizations
- The analysis is grounded in observable details
- The recommendations are prioritized and implementable

**Alternative applications:**

This same approach can be applied to:
- Different contexts within the same domain
- Related but distinct problem types
- Scaled up or down depending on scope
- Combined with complementary analytical frameworks


## Persistence Protocol Response

### Reframe
**The rejection:** 12 VC firms declined to invest.

**The lesson:** VCs follow patterns. They want to see traction, not potential. Your pitch is selling vision; they're buying proof. The rejection isn't about your idea—it's about their risk calculus.

**The opportunity:** Every rejection revealed what they need to see. You now know exactly what "traction" means to each of them. Estee couldn't get ad agencies to work with her—so she built demand without them, and they came to her. The same applies here: build the proof, and the money follows.

### Target Confirmation
**Original goal:** Raise VC funding to grow the startup.

**Still valid?** Partially. Funding is a means, not an end. The real goal is: build a successful company. VC is one route, not the only route.

**Refined target:** Generate enough traction or revenue that investors pursue YOU, or that you no longer need them at all.

### Alternative Routes
| Blocked Path | Alternative Route | Why It Might Work |
|-------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Cold pitching VCs | Get warm intros through customers/advisors who believe | Social proof from users outweighs your pitch |
| Seeking large seed round | Raise smaller angel checks from operators who get it | Angels bet on people; VCs bet on metrics |
| Pursuing investment first | Focus on revenue/traction, return when you have proof | Estee built demand before Saks said yes—create pull |
| Pitching to generalist VCs | Find investors who specialize in your space | Domain expertise means they see what generalists miss |
| Trying to convince skeptics | Find the already-convinced (customers who would prepay) | Revenue is the best fundraising deck |

### Refueling
**Your "why" revisited:** Why did you start this? What problem burns you? What would it mean for your customers if you succeeded? That purpose doesn't change because of 12 meetings.

**Past obstacle overcome:** You built something from nothing. You convinced people to join you, to try your product, to give you their time. Those "yes" answers came from the same you who heard "no" twelve times this month.

**One small win available now:** Email your three most enthusiastic customers. Ask: "What would it take for you to prepay for a year of service at a discount?" One prepayment is worth more than one investor meeting.

### The Next Action
**What:** Identify 3 operators/angels in your industry who have built similar companies. Request intros through your warmest mutual connections.

**When:** Draft intro request emails by end of day tomorrow.

**Why this route:** Operators who've built in your space don't need convincing about the market—they already believe. They invest in founders, not decks. And each one has a network of other operators.

### Estee's Reminder
"What, then, is the mystical ingredient? It's persistence. It's that certain little spirit that compels you to continue just when you're at your most tired. It's the immovable stubbornness that will not allow you to cave in when everyone says give up."

Twelve no's is not failure. Twelve no's is tuition. Now you know what they need to see. Go build it.
