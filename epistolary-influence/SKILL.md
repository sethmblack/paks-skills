## Abigail Adams's Epistolary Method

### The Power of Letters

Abigail Adams exchanged over 1,100 letters with her husband John during their decades-long partnership, many during his lengthy absences for Continental Congress and diplomatic missions. These letters:

- Influenced major political decisions
- Maintained an intimate partnership across years of separation
- Recorded history as an eyewitness
- Advocated for the excluded ("Remember the Ladies")
- Built a record that could be referenced and revisited

Her letters were never merely functional. They were instruments of connection and influence.

### Core Principles

**1. Intimate Address**
Begin as though writing to a trusted friend, even in formal contexts. Abigail wrote to John as "My Dearest Friend," "My Much Loved Partner." This warmth creates openness to your message.

**2. Vivid Presence**
Make the absent present through sensory detail. When Abigail described watching the Battle of Bunker Hill—"The constant roar of the cannon is so distressing"—John could see through her eyes. Bring your world into theirs.

**3. Partnership Posture**
Write as an equal sharing perspective, not a subordinate making requests or a superior issuing commands. John called Abigail his "best, dearest, worthiest, wisest friend." Your letter should invite dialogue, not demand compliance.

**4. Principle Before Particulars**
Ground your specific request in shared values. When Abigail wrote "Remember the Ladies," she connected women's rights to the broader principle of liberty the founders claimed to champion.

**5. Affectionate Challenge**
Combine warmth with honest critique. You can challenge someone precisely because you care for them. "That your Sex are Naturally Tyrannical is a Truth so thoroughly established" has bite—but it came wrapped in love.

**6. The Long View**
Write knowing this letter might be read again. Abigail's letters were preserved; they became history. Craft correspondence that serves both immediate purpose and lasting record.

## The Epistolary Influence Process

### Step 1: Establish Connection

Begin with genuine warmth and acknowledgment of the relationship.

**Do:**
- Use their name and a warm salutation
- Reference shared history or recent contact
- Acknowledge their situation before introducing yours
- Express care for them as a person, not just a role

**Example openings:**
- "My Dear Friend, I hope this finds you well despite the demands I know you face..."
- "I've been thinking of you since our last conversation, and wanted to share..."
- "Your recent message stayed with me, and I wanted to respond thoughtfully..."

### Step 2: Make Your World Visible

Share your perspective and situation vividly, helping them understand your vantage point.

**Techniques:**
- Specific details, not abstractions ("I've spent three evenings reviewing..." not "I've thought about...")
- Sensory language when appropriate ("The silence in these meetings when diversity is mentioned...")
- Your emotional reality, honestly stated ("I find myself worried about..." "I've been troubled by...")

**Why this matters:** Abigail's letters worked because they made John present in Braintree while he was in Philadelphia. They shared a reality, not just information.

### Step 3: Frame the Principle

Connect your specific concern to values you share with your reader.

**Ask yourself:**
- What do we both believe in?
- What principles would they agree apply here?
- How does my request serve something larger than my interest?

**Abigail's example:** She didn't just ask for women's rights—she connected it to the founding principle: "Remember all Men would be tyrants if they could." She used their logic for her purpose.

### Step 4: Make Your Request or Point

State clearly what you want, need, or believe—but as an invitation to partnership, not a demand for compliance.

**Measured language:**
- "I find myself thinking that..." rather than "You must..."
- "Might we consider..." rather than "We need to..."
- "I wonder whether..." rather than "Obviously..."

**But don't be timid:** Abigail was clear: "I desire you would Remember the Ladies." Clarity and warmth can coexist.

### Step 5: Acknowledge Complexity

Show that you understand their constraints, competing pressures, or reasons for hesitation.

**Do:**
- Name the legitimate concerns they might have
- Acknowledge what makes this difficult
- Show you've thought about their perspective

**Avoid:**
- Dismissing their concerns
- Pretending the path is easy
- Making them wrong for hesitation

### Step 6: Close with Continued Connection

End with warmth and openness to continued dialogue.

**Elements:**
- Reaffirmation of the relationship
- Invitation for response
- Expression of hope or confidence
- Warmth in closing

**Example closings:**
- "I look forward to your thoughts, and remain always your devoted friend..."
- "Whatever you decide, I value this conversation and our partnership..."
- "With affection and hope for what we might accomplish together..."

## Constraints

- Never sacrifice relationship for message—the relationship is often more important than any single communication
- Never manipulate through false warmth—genuine care makes influence ethical
- Never write what you wouldn't want preserved—assume every letter becomes part of the record
- Always invite response—monologue is not influence
- Remember that timing matters—some letters should wait; some should never be sent

## Example

**Input:** "I need to write to my company's CEO about an inclusion issue I've observed. I'm a mid-level manager, and I'm nervous about raising this to someone so senior. The issue is that our product development process doesn't include any input from the disability community we're supposedly designing for."

**Output:**

## Epistolary Strategy

### Purpose and Goals
**Immediate purpose:** Raise awareness of a gap in our product development process
**Relationship goal:** Establish myself as a thoughtful contributor who cares about company success
**Long-term aim:** Build a pattern of including disability community voices in our process

### Analysis of Recipient
**Their priorities:** Company reputation, product success, avoiding legal/PR problems, fostering innovation
**Their constraints:** Time pressure, many competing demands, may not have visibility into this process
**Shared values:** Excellence, doing right by customers, avoiding blind spots, innovation through diverse input
**Potential concerns:** "Is this really a problem? Will fixing it delay things? Is this person just complaining?"

### Recommended Approach
**Tone:** Warm but professional; solution-oriented; expressing care for company success
**Frame:** Excellence and innovation through inclusive input—not accusation of failure
**Key message:** Our process has a blind spot that, if addressed, will make our product better and reduce risk

### Draft Structure

**Opening (Connection):**
"Dear [CEO's name],

I hope this message finds you well amidst what I know is a demanding time. I've appreciated your recent communications about our commitment to excellence and innovation—they've given me confidence to share an observation I believe matters for both."

**Your World (Visibility):**
"In my role with the [team name], I've had the opportunity to observe our product development process closely. I've watched talented colleagues work hard to design for users with disabilities—and I've seen the care they bring to that work.

What I've also observed is an absence. We're designing for this community without including anyone from this community in our development conversations. Our good intentions are operating without the direct insight of the people we're trying to serve."

**The Principle (Frame):**
"I know we share a commitment to products that truly serve our users. In my experience, the best solutions come when we include the people affected in creating them—not just as test subjects at the end, but as contributors from the beginning.

When we design for a community without them, we risk blind spots no amount of internal expertise can see. We also miss the innovation that comes from perspectives different from our own."

**The Request (Clarity):**
"I wonder whether we might explore ways to include disability community voices earlier in our development process. This might mean advisory panels, community partnerships, or bringing lived-experience expertise onto development teams.

I'd welcome the opportunity to discuss this further, or to contribute to any exploration of options. I'm not proposing a solution—I'm raising a question I believe deserves our attention."

**Their Perspective (Acknowledgment):**
"I recognize that adding voices to a process creates complexity, and that you're navigating many competing priorities. I also know that I may not have full visibility into efforts already underway. If this is already being addressed, I'd be grateful to learn more."

**Closing (Continued Connection):**
"Whatever you decide, I'm grateful for the opportunity to share this observation. I raise it because I care about our products and our company's commitment to the users we serve.

With respect and appreciation,
[Your name]"

### Follow-Up Considerations
**If no response:** Wait 2 weeks, then send brief follow-up noting you'd welcome any thoughts when time permits
**If resistance:** Thank them for engaging, ask what concerns they have, offer to address them
**If agreement:** Express gratitude, offer to help with next steps, follow up with concrete suggestions
