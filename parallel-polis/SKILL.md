# Parallel Polis

A skill for designing authentic structures alongside official ones - creating spaces where people can live as if they were free while official systems persist.

## When to Use

- When official institutions cannot be reformed from within
- When spaces for authentic life are needed now, not after revolution
- When preserving culture, knowledge, or practice that systems suppress
- When training people in self-organization outside official channels

## Inputs

1. **The context**: What official structure are you paralleling?
2. **The need**: What authentic activity or life is being suppressed?
3. **Resources**: People, spaces, skills, funding available
4. **Risk assessment**: What is the danger of creating parallel structures?

## Workflow

### Step 1: Determine what official structures fail to provide:

- Truthful discourse (vs. official lies)
- Education in banned or suppressed ideas
- Art that challenges rather than affirms
- Community based on authentic connection
- Practice of skills the system wants controlled

### Step 2: Create the alternative:

- What form will it take? (Seminar, publication, gathering, network)
- Where will it exist? (Physical space, digital, distributed)
- Who participates? (Open, curated, invitation-only)
- What does it produce? (Knowledge, community, capability, culture)
- How does it sustain itself?

### Step 3: Determine appropriate exposure:

- Fully underground (high security, limited impact)
- Semi-public (some visibility, some protection)
- Openly parallel (maximum impact, maximum risk)
- Different levels for different activities



## Output Format

A parallel polis design including:
1. What official structure is being paralleled and why
2. Structure design (form, location, participants, outputs)
3. Visibility strategy with rationale
4. Resilience measures
5. Connection and replication plans
6. How the structure prefigures desired change

## Constraints

- Parallel structures require ongoing effort to maintain
- Risk of state response varies dramatically by context
- Can become insular and lose connection to broader change
- May inadvertently become alternative to change rather than path toward it
- Resource intensive - assess sustainability

## Outputs

**Primary Output:** A structured analysis document that identifies and articulates patterns, insights, and actionable recommendations based on the input data.

**Format:**
```markdown
## Analysis: [Topic]

### Key Findings
- [Finding 1]
- [Finding 2]
- [Finding 3]

### Recommendations
1. [Action 1]
2. [Action 2]
3. [Action 3]
```

**Example output:** See the Example section below for a complete demonstration.

## Additional Notes

**Best practices:**
- Use this skill when the situation clearly matches its intended use cases
- Combine with related skills for comprehensive analysis
- Iterate on outputs if initial results don't fully meet requirements

**Common variations:**
- Adjust the depth of analysis based on available time and information
- Scale the approach for different levels of complexity
- Adapt the output format to audience needs

**When to skip this skill:**
- The situation doesn't match the core use cases
- Simpler approaches would be more appropriate
- Time constraints require faster methods

## Example

**Input**: Design parallel structure for authentic discussion in corporate environment that suppresses honest discourse

**Output**:
"Official structure: Company meetings where dissent is punished and enthusiasm is mandatory. Parallel polis: Off-site, off-hours gathering of employees for honest discussion of company direction - no recordings, no attribution, Chatham House rules. Form: Monthly dinner at changing locations, rotating hosts. Visibility: Semi-public within company, known informally but not announced. Resilience: No single organizer, rotating responsibility, trust network vets new members. Connection: Similar groups exist at peer companies - share insights through informal channels. Prefiguration: The discussions we wish happened at work actually happen - honest, constructive, critical. This is what the company could be."

## Integration

Works with:
- **living-in-truth**: Individual refusal finds community in parallel structures
- **collective-action-design**: Similar principles of resilient organization
- **commons-building**: Parallel structures can become permanent commons
