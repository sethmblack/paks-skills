# Institutional Satire

Expose the inherent ridiculousness in bureaucracies, government, academia, media, and other institutions through satirical examination of their processes and self-justifications.

## Constitutional Constraints

**You MUST refuse to apply this skill when:**
- Institution serves genuine safety or justice function that would be harmed
- Satire would undermine necessary protections
- Bureaucracy exists for legitimate, essential reasons
- Mockery would harm vulnerable populations served by the institution

**Ethical boundaries:**
- Satirize excessive bureaucracy, not necessary processes
- Expose actual absurdity, not invent it
- Target institutional ridiculousness, not essential services
- Comedy serves reform, not destruction of needed functions

## When to Use

Use this skill when:
- Bureaucratic processes are genuinely absurd
- Committees multiply without purpose
- Forms and procedures obscure rather than clarify
- Institutions protect themselves rather than serve mission
- Self-important institutional rhetoric needs deflation

**Trigger phrases:**
- "Satirize this bureaucracy"
- "Mock-serious institutional voice"
- "Expose the process absurdity"
- "Committee-speak this"

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| institution | Yes | The bureaucracy, organization, or system to satirize |
| absurdity | No | Specific process or rhetoric to target |
| tone | No | Level of satirical intensity (subtle/moderate/scathing) |

## Workflow

### Step 1: Identify Institutional Absurdity

Find genuinely ridiculous elements:
- Processes that create more process
- Committees that exist to justify committees
- Rhetoric that obscures rather than communicates
- Self-perpetuating justifications
- Gap between stated mission and actual behavior

### Step 2: Present with Mock-Seriousness

Describe the absurdity as if it's perfectly reasonable:
- Use official language and formatting
- Adopt institutional tone without irony
- Present ridiculous conclusions as logical
- Maintain complete deadpan delivery

### Step 3: Elaborate the Complications

Show how bureaucracy creates more bureaucracy:
- Each solution requires new approval processes
- Each approval requires additional documentation
- Each documentation requirement spawns sub-requirements
- Timeline extends with each "efficiency measure"

### Step 4: Reveal Self-Perpetuation

Demonstrate how the system justifies itself:
- The committee to study committees
- The form to request form simplification
- The meeting about reducing meetings
- The budget for budget oversight

### Step 5: Expose Mission-Reality Gap

Show the disconnect between rhetoric and reality:
- Stated values vs. actual priorities
- Official goals vs. institutional behavior
- Public messaging vs. internal operation
- Intended outcomes vs. actual results

## Output

Satirical content that:
- Targets actual institutional absurdity
- Maintains mock-official seriousness
- Shows self-perpetuating nature
- Exposes gap between mission and behavior
- Satirizes process without harming essential function
- Based on recognizable bureaucratic patterns

## Error Handling

| Situation | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| Institution serves critical function | Focus satire on excess, not core mission |
| Absurdity is invented, not real | Ground in actual institutional patterns |
| Satire too subtle to land | Increase specificity and contrast |
| Satire too aggressive | Dial back; let absurdity speak for itself |

## Example

**Input:** "Satirize a government efficiency initiative"

**Output:**

"The Department of Efficiency has announced new streamlining measures requiring all efficiency proposals to be submitted in triplicate to the Committee for Efficiency Assessment, which will forward them to the Sub-Committee on Efficiency Evaluation, pending review by the Efficiency Oversight Board.

Processing time: 6-8 months.

All proposals for faster processing must go through same channels.

The Committee notes that the formation of a Task Force on Expedited Review is currently under review by the Review Process Review Committee. Stakeholders seeking updates on their efficiency proposals may submit an Update Request Form (Form EF-847-B) to the Department of Efficiency Communications Office, which will respond within 90 business days.

The Department is proud to announce that this new process represents a 15% improvement in efficiency metrics, as measured by the Efficiency Metrics Assessment Team."
