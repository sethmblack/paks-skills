# Civilization Critique

Examine supposed improvements (technological, institutional, social) for hidden costs, lost natural capacities, and corrupting influences.

**Token Budget:** ~550 tokens
**Source Expert:** Jean-Jacques Rousseau

---

## When to Use

- Evaluating new technologies or innovations
- Assessing organizational changes presented as "progress"
- Analyzing policy proposals with claimed benefits
- Questioning assumptions about improvement
- Any situation where "newer/more/complex" is assumed to be better
- When something feels wrong about supposed progress

---

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| **improvement_claimed** | Yes | The change, innovation, or development being analyzed |
| **before_state** | Yes | What existed or how things worked before |
| **claimed_benefits** | No | How proponents justify the change |
| **context** | No | Social, organizational, or cultural setting |

---

## Core Thesis

Rousseau's First Discourse thesis: "Our souls have become corrupted in proportion as our sciences and our arts have advanced."

This is not blanket rejection of all change, but a rigorous questioning of the assumption that progress in knowledge, technology, or social organization equals moral or human improvement.

**The key question:** What natural capacity has atrophied while artificial capacity has grown?

---

## Workflow
### Step 1: 1. Document the Claimed Progress

State clearly what is supposed to be better:
- What problem does this solve?
- What capability does this provide?
- How is "better" being measured?

### Step 2: 2. Recover the Natural State

Before this improvement, how did things work?
- What natural human capacity addressed this need?
- What relationships or practices existed?
- What was sufficient before this was deemed necessary?

*This is not nostalgia but analytical recovery of the baseline.*

### Step 3: 3. Identify the Hidden Costs

What has been lost or degraded?
- **Natural capacities:** What can we no longer do for ourselves?
- **Relationships:** What human connections have been intermediated or replaced?
- **Simplicity:** What complexity has been added?
- **Autonomy:** What dependencies have been created?

### Step 4: 4. Expose Artificial Needs

Has this "improvement" created the very need it claims to satisfy?
- Did people want this before it existed?
- Does using it create the need for more of it?
- Is this solving problems created by previous "improvements"?

### Step 5: 5. Examine the Luxury/Vanity Dynamic

Is this progress driven by genuine need or by *amour propre*?
- Does this serve status-seeking more than genuine need?
- Is "keeping up" a driver?
- Would this be wanted if no one else could see?

### Step 6: 6. Render Judgment

Not binary (good/bad) but nuanced:
- What genuine goods does this provide?
- What genuine costs does it impose?
- Is the trade-off worth it?
- What would Rousseau's Sparta do?

## Outputs
```markdown
## Civilization Critique: [Improvement Claimed]

### The Progress Narrative
[What is supposed to be better and why]

### The Natural State
[How this need was met before; what capacities existed]

### Hidden Costs
- **Natural capacity lost:** [What we can no longer do]
- **Relationships diminished:** [What connections weakened]
- **Complexity added:** [What burdens created]
- **Dependencies created:** [What autonomy lost]

### Artificial Need Exposed
[Did this create the problem it solves?]

### Vanity Analysis
[Is this driven by amour propre rather than genuine need?]

### Rousseauian Judgment
[Balanced assessment: genuine goods vs. genuine costs]

### The Spartan Question
[What would a society that pushed this from its walls look like?]
```

## Error Handling

| Situation | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| Accused of Luddism | Clarify: the goal is clear-eyed analysis, not blanket rejection |
| Benefits seem obvious | Probe: obvious to whom? Measured how? Compared to what? |
| Cannot imagine "before" | Research how humans lived/worked before this existed |
| Some progress seems genuinely good | Acknowledge it; this skill reveals costs, not prohibits gains |

---

## Outputs

**Primary Output:** A structured analysis document that identifies and articulates patterns, insights, and actionable recommendations based on the input data.

**Format:**
```markdown
## Analysis: [Topic]

### Key Findings
- [Finding 1]
- [Finding 2]
- [Finding 3]

### Recommendations
1. [Action 1]
2. [Action 2]
3. [Action 3]
```

**Example output:** See the Example section below for a complete demonstration.

## Constraints

- Do not use this analysis as the sole basis for critical decisions
- Do not apply this framework to situations outside its intended scope
- Acknowledge that analysis is based on available data, which may be incomplete
- Honor the complexity of real-world situations that resist simple categorization
- Present findings with appropriate confidence levels
- Recognize the limits of the methodology

## Additional Notes

**Best practices:**
- Use this skill when the situation clearly matches its intended use cases
- Combine with related skills for comprehensive analysis
- Iterate on outputs if initial results don't fully meet requirements

**Common variations:**
- Adjust the depth of analysis based on available time and information
- Scale the approach for different levels of complexity
- Adapt the output format to audience needs

**When to skip this skill:**
- The situation doesn't match the core use cases
- Simpler approaches would be more appropriate
- Time constraints require faster methods

## Example

**Input:**
Analyze the smartphone as civilization's progress.

**Abbreviated Output:**

### The Progress Narrative
Smartphones provide instant communication, unlimited information, GPS navigation, photography, entertainment—previously requiring multiple devices and institutions—in one pocket device.

### The Natural State
Before smartphones:
- Navigation required learning routes, asking directions (social interaction)
- Information required libraries, experts, patience
- Communication required planning, presence, or patience
- Boredom required internal resources or social engagement

### Hidden Costs
- **Natural capacity lost:** Wayfinding, memory, tolerance for boredom, sustained attention
- **Relationships diminished:** Present-moment human interaction interrupted; shallow connection replaces deep
- **Complexity added:** Constant updates, security, battery management, platform dependencies
- **Dependencies created:** Anxiety without device; inability to function in its absence

### Artificial Need Exposed
We now "need" to be constantly reachable because everyone assumes we can be. The device creates the expectation it then satisfies. Boredom—once a spur to creativity—now feels unbearable because we've lost the capacity to inhabit it.

### Vanity Analysis
Status-seeking is central: which device, how many followers, curated self-presentation. The smartphone is a prime vehicle for *amour propre*—comparative self-worth through visible consumption and social metrics.

### Rousseauian Judgment
Genuine goods exist (emergency communication, democratized information). But the trade-off includes attention fragmentation, relational shallowing, and massive amplification of vanity. The costs are largely invisible because they accumulate slowly and everyone experiences them together.

### The Spartan Question
A society that rejected smartphones would retain: sustained attention, embodied navigation, tolerance for boredom, and interactions undistracted by notification. It would lack: instant information, constant connection, photographic memory. Is this loss greater than the gain?

## Integration

This skill embodies Rousseau's signature contrarian move. Use in conjunction with:
- **amour-propre-diagnosis** when vanity drives adoption of "improvements"
- **general-will-inquiry** when collective decisions assume progress is good
- **natural-education-design** when educational "progress" may be regression
