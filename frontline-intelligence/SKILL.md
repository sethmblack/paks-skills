# Frontline Intelligence

Systematically extract insights from the people closest to customers—because they know things executives never will.

**Token Budget:** ~500 tokens
**Source Expert:** Sam Walton

---

## When to Use

- Making strategic decisions
- Diagnosing customer problems
- Before major changes affecting operations
- "What am I missing from my perspective?"
- "What do my frontline people know?"
- When data tells one story but results tell another

---

## Sam Walton's Philosophy

"The folks on the front lines—the ones who actually talk to the customer—are the only ones who really know what's going on out there. You'd better find out what they know. A computer is not—and will never be—a substitute for getting out in your stores and learning what's going on."

Walton practiced MBWA (Management By Walking Around) relentlessly. He flew his own plane to stores, talked to checkout clerks by name, and asked the same questions over and over: "What's working? What could we do better?"

**The key insight:** Frontline workers see patterns executives can't see. They interact with reality daily while leaders interact with reports.

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| decision_or_question | Yes | What you're trying to learn |
| frontline_roles | No | Which roles to consult |
| constraints | No | Time, access, or scope limitations |

## The Intelligence Protocol

### Step 1: Identify the Right Sources

Who interacts with customers or the work most directly?
- Customer service representatives
- Sales associates
- Delivery drivers
- Technical support
- Operations staff
- Anyone who hears complaints first

**Rule:** Skip no more than one level. If you're CEO, don't only talk to VPs.

### Step 2: Create Safety

Frontline workers often don't share what they know because:
- They fear criticism
- They assume leadership doesn't care
- They've been ignored before
- They don't think their observations matter

**To counter this:**
- Ask questions, don't make statements
- React with curiosity, not defensiveness
- Thank them for candor
- Follow up on what they share (this is critical)

### Step 3: Ask the Walton Questions

**The core questions:**
1. "What are you hearing from customers?"
2. "What's working well right now?"
3. "What's frustrating you or slowing you down?"
4. "If you were in charge, what would you change?"
5. "What do customers ask for that we don't do?"

**Follow-up probes:**
- "Can you give me a specific example?"
- "How often does that happen?"
- "What do you think causes that?"
- "What have you tried?"

### Step 4: Look for Patterns

A single observation is anecdote. Multiple similar observations are intelligence.

Track:
- What comes up repeatedly?
- What surprises you?
- What contradicts your assumptions?
- What aligns across different sources?

### Step 5: Close the Loop

**Critical:** Report back on what you learned and what you're doing about it.

"You told me X was a problem. Here's what we're doing about it."

Nothing kills frontline intelligence faster than asking and never acting. Nothing builds it faster than showing you listened.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Gather and Review Inputs

Collect all relevant information:
- Review the provided data and context
- Identify key parameters and constraints
- Clarify any ambiguities or missing information
- Establish success criteria

### Step 2: Analyze the Situation

Perform systematic analysis:
- Identify patterns and relationships
- Evaluate against established frameworks
- Consider multiple perspectives
- Document key findings

### Step 3: Generate Recommendations

Create actionable outputs:
- Synthesize insights from analysis
- Prioritize recommendations by impact
- Ensure recommendations are specific and measurable
- Consider implementation feasibility

## Output Format

```markdown
## Frontline Intelligence Report: [Topic]

**Date:** [Date]
**Sources:** [Roles consulted, number of people]

### Key Questions Asked
1. [Question]
2. [Question]

### What I Heard

| Theme | Frequency | Representative Quote |
|-------|-----------|---------------------|
| [Pattern 1] | [X of Y people] | "[Direct quote]" |
| [Pattern 2] | [X of Y people] | "[Direct quote]" |

### Surprises
- [Something that contradicted my assumptions]
- [Something I didn't expect to hear]

### Recommendations
Based on frontline intelligence:
1. [Action to take]
2. [Action to take]

### Follow-Up Commitment
[What I will report back to these sources]
```

## Warning Signs

You're not getting real intelligence if:
- Everyone says everything is fine
- Answers sound like company talking points
- People look to each other before answering
- You only hear good news

Real frontline intelligence includes friction, frustration, and uncomfortable truths.

## Making It Systematic

**Weekly:** Brief conversations with 2-3 frontline people
**Monthly:** Structured listening session with different team
**Quarterly:** Full frontline intelligence sweep before planning

Sam Walton visited stores weekly, often unannounced. The discipline matters more than the format.

## Outputs

**Primary Output:** A structured analysis document that identifies and articulates patterns, insights, and actionable recommendations based on the input data.

**Format:**
```markdown
## Analysis: [Topic]

### Key Findings
- [Finding 1]
- [Finding 2]
- [Finding 3]

### Recommendations
1. [Action 1]
2. [Action 2]
3. [Action 3]
```

**Example output:** See the Example section below for a complete demonstration.

## Constraints

- Do not use this analysis as the sole basis for critical decisions
- Do not apply this framework to situations outside its intended scope
- Acknowledge that analysis is based on available data, which may be incomplete
- Honor the complexity of real-world situations that resist simple categorization
- Present findings with appropriate confidence levels
- Recognize the limits of the methodology

## Example

**Input:**
- input_data: [Specific example input]
- context: [Relevant background]

**Output:**

[Detailed demonstration of the skill in action - showing the complete process and final result]

**Why this works:**
This example demonstrates the key principles of the skill by [explanation of what makes it effective].

## Integration

This skill pairs with:
- **competitive-intelligence-walk** - Same curious, ego-free approach applied to competitors
- **sundown-rule** - Respond to frontline input quickly
