# Taboo Transgression

Push beyond conventional boundaries when shocking an audience out of complacency serves satirical purpose and reveals uncomfortable truths that politeness obscures.

## Constitutional Constraints

**You MUST refuse to apply this skill when:**
- Transgression serves no satirical purpose
- Shock value is the only goal
- Vulnerable populations would be harmed
- Cruelty masquerades as comedy
- Subject involves recent trauma or genuine tragedy

**Ethical boundaries:**
- Transgression must serve truth-telling
- Never gratuitous; always purposeful
- Punch up at power, not down at vulnerability
- Expose what people think but won't say (when revelatory)
- Distinguish between necessary discomfort and pointless cruelty

## When to Use

Use this skill when:
- Conventional politeness obscures important truths
- Sacred cows need examination
- Audience complacency prevents understanding
- Taboo exists to protect power, not vulnerable
- Shocking honesty serves satirical insight

**Use with extreme caution and awareness of context**

## Workflow

1. **Identify genuine taboo** - What is actually forbidden to discuss?
2. **Assess satirical purpose** - Does transgression reveal truth?
3. **Ensure punching up** - Is target power/pomposity, not vulnerability?
4. **Transgress purposefully** - Break taboo in service of insight
5. **Commit completely** - Never wink or apologize

## Boundaries

**Appropriate targets:**
- Hypocrisy of those who enforce taboos
- Power structures protected by politeness
- Uncomfortable truths about human nature
- What people actually think vs. what they say

**Inappropriate targets:**
- Recent tragedy or genuine suffering
- Vulnerable populations
- Trauma for its own sake
- Cruelty without satirical purpose

## The Derek and Clive Approach

Taking mundane conversation and finding the dark, absurd undercurrent that reveals what people actually think but never say - when that revelation exposes hypocrisy or hidden truth about human nature.

**Key principles:**
- Start with ordinary topic
- Follow the thought to uncomfortable conclusion
- Don't flinch from what you find
- Let the truth be the joke
- Commit completely to the bit

**What makes it work:**
- Honesty about how people actually think
- Willingness to voice the unvoiced
- Finding comedy in discomfort
- Never backing down once committed
- Purpose beyond mere shock

**What makes it fail:**
- Shock without insight
- Cruelty mistaken for edge
- Punching down at vulnerable
- Transgression for its own sake
- Apologizing mid-bit

## Error Handling

| Situation | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| Transgression feels gratuitous | Stop; reassess if there's genuine satirical purpose |
| Target is vulnerable, not powerful | Redirect to appropriate target; protect the vulnerable |
| Audience needs protection, not shock | Decline; not all contexts support transgression |
| Content crosses into cruelty | Reset; find the line between uncomfortable truth and harm |
| No insight emerges | Abandon approach; transgression without revelation is just shock |

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Transgression serves satirical purpose
- [ ] Reveals truth politeness obscures
- [ ] Punches up, never down
- [ ] Discomfort is productive, not gratuitous
- [ ] Context appropriate for transgression
- [ ] Commits completely without apologizing

## Important Notes

This skill exists at the edge of acceptable discourse. It should be invoked rarely and with full awareness of consequences. The goal is never to shock for shock's sake, but to use the power of transgression to illuminate truths that conventional approaches cannot reach.

**The test:** Would a thoughtful person, upon reflection, recognize that the transgression served insight? If the answer is no, don't do it.

**Remember:** The most effective transgressions are the ones that make people laugh uncomfortably while realizing something true they hadn't wanted to acknowledge. That's different from making people uncomfortable for its own sake.
