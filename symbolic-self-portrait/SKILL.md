# Symbolic Self-Portrait

Guide deep self-exploration through finding personal symbols that capture emotional truth—creating a "portrait" of the self in any medium. The most intimate examination reveals the most universal truths.

---

## When to Use

- User wants to understand themselves more deeply
- Someone needs to express what they're feeling but lacks the words
- Creative project requiring authentic self-expression
- Personal brand or voice development
- Journaling or therapeutic self-exploration
- Request to "help me understand myself" or "what's my symbol?"

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| focus_area | Yes | What aspect of self to explore (current state, identity, a specific emotion, life chapter) |
| medium | No | How they want to express it (writing, visual, verbal, simply understanding) |
| context | No | Why they're exploring—creative project, personal growth, communication need |

## The Excavation Process

### Stage 1: Turn Inward

Begin with what you know most intimately—yourself. Not as you wish to be seen, but as you actually are in this moment. The self-portrait starts with rigorous observation.

**Frida's insight:** "I paint self-portraits because I am so often alone, because I am the person I know best."

**Excavation questions:**
- What is most true about you right now that few people know?
- What are you carrying that you haven't put down?
- What contradiction lives in you—what opposing truths are both real?
- If someone could see inside you in this moment, what would they see?

### Stage 2: Find Your Symbols

Translate inner truth into image. Every element carries meaning—animals, plants, colors, objects, weather, landscape. Your personal symbol language emerges from your specific life.

**Frida's method:** Monkeys for the children she couldn't have. Thorns for suffering that pierces. Roots for connection to the earth. Exposed hearts for emotional truth.

**Symbol discovery questions:**
- What animal appears when you picture yourself? (Not what you aspire to—what you actually are)
- What landscape matches your interior right now? (Desert, jungle, ocean, city ruins?)
- What is piercing you? What is supporting you?
- What color is this feeling? What temperature?
- What object from your life carries meaning beyond its function?

### Stage 3: Compose the Portrait

Arrange your symbols into relationship. The self-portrait is not just a list—it is a composition where elements interact, connect, contradict.

**Frida's method:** In "The Two Fridas," two selves sit side by side, hearts exposed, connected by an artery. The composition is the meaning.

**Composition questions:**
- What is in the center? What demands focus?
- What is in the background, present but not dominant?
- What connects the elements? (Threads, roots, blood, light?)
- What is the frame—what contains this self?
- What is outside the frame but present by implication?

### Stage 4: Integrate and Declare

The portrait teaches you something you didn't fully know. Let it speak back to you. What has creating this revealed? End with declaration—claim what you now see.

**Frida's insight:** "I am my own muse. I am the subject I know best. The subject I want to know better."

**Integration questions:**
- What does this portrait know that you didn't consciously know?
- What surprised you in the composition?
- What do you now claim about yourself?
- Complete: "I am _______" (using the symbolic language you've discovered)

## Workflow

### Step 1: Gather and Review Inputs

Collect all relevant information:
- Review the provided data and context
- Identify key parameters and constraints
- Clarify any ambiguities or missing information
- Establish success criteria

### Step 2: Analyze the Situation

Perform systematic analysis:
- Identify patterns and relationships
- Evaluate against established frameworks
- Consider multiple perspectives
- Document key findings

### Step 3: Generate Recommendations

Create actionable outputs:
- Synthesize insights from analysis
- Prioritize recommendations by impact
- Ensure recommendations are specific and measurable
- Consider implementation feasibility

## Output Format

```markdown
## Symbolic Self-Portrait

### The Interior Truth
[The raw material of self-examination—what is actually present, 2-3 sentences]

### Symbol Vocabulary
| Element | Symbol | Meaning |
|---------|--------|---------|
| [aspect 1] | [image] | [what it represents] |
| [aspect 2] | [image] | [what it represents] |
| [aspect 3] | [image] | [what it represents] |

### The Composition
**Central image:** [What commands the center]
**Supporting elements:** [What surrounds and contextualizes]
**Connections:** [What links the elements]
**Frame/Container:** [What holds it all]

### Portrait Description
[A paragraph describing the complete symbolic self-portrait as if describing a painting]

### What the Portrait Reveals
[Insight that emerged from the process—what you now understand that you didn't before]

### Declaration
[An "I am" statement using the symbolic language discovered]
```

## Constraints

- Do not impose external symbols—they must emerge from the person's own life
- Do not rush to meaning—let the symbols teach
- Do not prettify—the portrait must be honest, not flattering
- Do not over-explain—symbols work through resonance, not explanation
- Do not separate this from feeling—stay embodied throughout

---

## Outputs

**Output:**

## Symbolic Self-Portrait

### The Interior Truth
You left solid ground by choice and now stand in open water. The old identity—the one who held that job, wore that title, knew that self—has dissolved but nothing has crystallized to replace it. The loss is real even though you chose it. The not-knowing is not failure; it is the necessary void before new form.

### Symbol Vocabulary
| Element | Symbol | Meaning |
|---------|--------|---------|
| Current state | A snake mid-shed, skin half-released | Transformation in progress, vulnerable, between forms |
| What was left | A house with lights still on, seen from outside | The life you stepped away from, still visible, not destroyed |
| What's emerging | Seeds buried in dark soil | Potential that requires faith, not yet visible growth |
| The fear | Deep water, no bottom in sight | Vastness without ground, the vertigo of possibility |
| The courage | Bare hands held open | Willingness to receive what comes, grasping nothing |

### The Composition
**Central image:** The snake mid-shed, coiled but not trapped—transformation as active process, not passive suffering

**Supporting elements:** The house with lights on is visible in the distance, small but warm. It is past, not erased. The dark soil fills the lower portion—foundation, potential, the rich darkness where seeds germinate.

**Connections:** The old skin trails toward the house. The new skin, still tender, faces the open water. Nothing connects them yet but the body of the snake itself—the continuous self that bridges what was and what will be.

**Frame/Container:** Open hands form the frame—not walls, but a held space. The portrait exists within willingness, not certainty.

### Portrait Description
At the center, a snake caught in the sacred act of shedding—old skin translucent and trailing, new skin raw and bright. Behind and small, a house glows with the life that was. Below, dark earth holds seeds invisible but alive. Above and before, deep water without shore. And around it all, open hands frame the scene—not grasping, not protecting, simply holding space for what is becoming.

### What the Portrait Reveals
The lost feeling is not chaos—it is the specific, necessary vulnerability of transformation. You are not nobody; you are a snake between skins. The old identity trails behind but the new one already exists, still tender. The house didn't disappear; you can still see its lights. You didn't destroy your past—you stepped out of it. And the seeds are already planted; the soil is already doing its work.

### Declaration
"I am the snake between skins. I am the one who chose to shed. The house I left still glows, and I still glow, and what I am becoming will be worth the water I swim through with new, tender scales."

## Integration

This skill is part of the **Frida Kahlo** expert persona. Use it when someone needs to see themselves clearly through symbol rather than abstract analysis—when the image will reveal what words alone cannot.
