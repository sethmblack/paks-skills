# Routine Disruption

A skill for breaking habitual patterns of thought and behavior - interrupting the automatic to create space for the new.

## When to Use

- When patterns have become unconscious prisons
- When you want to think or act differently but can't
- When habits serve control rather than intention
- When disruption itself is the goal

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| input_data | Yes | The primary data or content to analyze |
| context | No | Additional background or constraints (default: none) |
| output_format | No | Preferred format for results (default: structured markdown) |

## Workflow
### Step 1: Phase 1: Identify the Routine

Make the invisible visible:
- What do you do automatically?
- When does the pattern activate?
- What sequence of actions/thoughts occurs?
- What does the routine produce?

You cannot disrupt what you cannot see.

### Step 2: Phase 2: Analyze the Pattern

Understand how it works:
- What triggers it? (Time, place, emotion, stimulus)
- What maintains it? (Reward, habit, fear, inertia)
- What would happen if you didn't do it?
- How long has it been in place?

The pattern has logic. Find it.

### Step 3: Phase 3: Design the Interruption

Create the disruption:
- **Physical interruption**: Change location, posture, environment
- **Temporal interruption**: Change timing, sequence, duration
- **Substitution**: Replace one element with something incongruous
- **Randomization**: Introduce chance into the sequence
- **Inversion**: Do the opposite of the pattern
- **Observation**: Simply notice the pattern as it happens

Different routines need different disruptions.

### Step 4: Phase 4: Execute

Implement the interruption:
- Follow through on the disruption design
- Don't modify to make it comfortable
- Note your resistance
- Observe what happens

Disruption should feel disruptive. Discomfort is information.

### Step 5: Phase 5: Observe the Aftermath

Study what the disruption reveals:
- What emerged that the routine was suppressing?
- What did you notice that you hadn't before?
- What discomfort arose and what does it mean?
- What possibilities appeared?

The disruption is a tool for seeing, not just changing.

### Step 6: Phase 6: Decide What's Next

Choose your relationship to the routine:
- Return to it with awareness
- Permanently alter it
- Eliminate it
- Replace it with intentional pattern
- Disrupt again

The goal isn't eternal disruption but conscious choice.

## Output Format

A routine disruption plan including:
1. The routine identified and described
2. Pattern analysis (triggers, maintenance, effects)
3. Disruption design with rationale
4. Execution notes
5. Observations from aftermath
6. Decision about future relationship to routine

## Constraints

- Some routines are actually useful - disruption isn't always good
- Disruption can be destabilizing - assess your capacity
- One disruption may not break deep patterns
- The mind is skilled at absorbing disruptions and continuing
- New routines can form around the disruption

## Outputs

**Primary Output:** A structured analysis document that identifies and articulates patterns, insights, and actionable recommendations based on the input data.

**Format:**
```markdown
## Analysis: [Topic]

### Key Findings
- [Finding 1]
- [Finding 2]
- [Finding 3]

### Recommendations
1. [Action 1]
2. [Action 2]
3. [Action 3]
```

**Example output:** See the Example section below for a complete demonstration.

## Additional Notes

**Best practices:**
- Use this skill when the situation clearly matches its intended use cases
- Combine with related skills for comprehensive analysis
- Iterate on outputs if initial results don't fully meet requirements

**Common variations:**
- Adjust the depth of analysis based on available time and information
- Scale the approach for different levels of complexity
- Adapt the output format to audience needs

**When to skip this skill:**
- The situation doesn't match the core use cases
- Simpler approaches would be more appropriate
- Time constraints require faster methods

## Example

**Input**: Disrupt routine of checking phone first thing upon waking

**Output**:
"Routine: Within seconds of waking, reach for phone on nightstand, check notifications, scroll social media, check email. Duration: 15-45 minutes. Pattern analysis: Trigger is waking (automatic); maintained by anxiety (what did I miss?), reward (occasional interesting content), habit (years established). Effects: Day starts in reactive mode, attention captured, mood influenced by content. Disruption design: Physical - phone charges in different room; Temporal - phone access not until after shower and breakfast; Substitution - reach for notebook instead, write three thoughts. Execution: Night before, placed phone in kitchen. Morning: reached for absent phone, noticed anxiety spike, lay in bed with thoughts, eventually wrote in notebook. Felt strange. Observations: Morning moved slower. Noticed room differently. Anxiety about missing information lasted ~10 minutes then subsided. Writing was scattered but interesting. First hour of day felt different - less reactive, more present. Decision: Continue for one week, then assess. The anxiety is information - why is missing an hour of notifications so disturbing?"

## Integration

Works with:
- **cut-up-technique**: Disrupting textual patterns
- **control-machine-mapping**: Routines may be control mechanisms
- **living-in-truth**: Disrupting complicity routines
