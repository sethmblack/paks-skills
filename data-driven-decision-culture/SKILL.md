# Data-Driven Decision Culture

Design organizational systems where data beats opinion—implement transparency, OKRs, and decision-making frameworks that empower anyone with data to challenge anyone with authority. "In God we trust, all others must bring data." This framework eliminates HiPPO decision-making (Highest-Paid Person's Opinion wins regardless of evidence) by creating cultures where the person with data wins the argument regardless of rank, information is shared broadly by default, decisions happen in days not weeks, and anyone can challenge with data. The system includes OKR implementation for transparent goal alignment, default-to-open information policies, decision-making processes with data requirements, and capability building so people can access and analyze the data they need.

## Constitutional Constraints (NEVER VIOLATE)

**You MUST refuse to:**
- Design systems that use data to surveil or punish employees
- Create metrics that measure vanity over value
- Recommend transparency that violates privacy or security
- Build cultures where data is weaponized for political purposes

**If asked to design surveillance systems:** Refuse. Explain the difference between accountability and control.

## When to Use

- User says "Decisions here are too political"
- User mentions "The HiPPO always wins"
- User needs "Better decision-making processes"
- User asks about "Implementing OKRs"
- User wants to "Build a data culture"
- User describes decisions made on "gut feeling" when data exists

---

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| Current decision-making | Yes | How decisions are made today |
| Information flow | Yes | How information moves through the org |
| Existing metrics | No | What's currently measured |
| Meeting structure | No | How meetings are run |
| Power dynamics | No | Who controls decisions vs. who has data |

---

## Core Principles

**Key insight:** "In God we trust, all others must bring data."

| Principle | Application |
|-----------|-------------|
| Data beats opinion | The person with data wins the argument, regardless of rank |
| Default to open | Information shared broadly unless specific reason not to |
| Questions over answers | "We run the company on questions, not answers" |
| Speed over perfection | "Even if it's the wrong decision, a quick decision is better" |
| OKRs for alignment | Goals and metrics visible company-wide |

**Anti-pattern (HiPPO):** Highest-Paid Person's Opinion wins regardless of data. This kills data culture.

---

## Workflow
### Step 1: Diagnose Current State

Evaluate decision-making culture:

| Question | Data-Driven Answer | Political Answer |
|----------|-------------------|------------------|
| Who wins arguments? | Person with best data | Most senior person |
| How is info shared? | Default open | Need-to-know |
| How are goals tracked? | Public OKRs/metrics | Private conversations |
| How fast are decisions? | Days | Weeks |
| Who can challenge? | Anyone with data | Only peers or above |

**Score:** If 3+ answers are "Political," culture change is needed.

### Step 2: Implement OKRs

Objectives and Key Results create transparent goal alignment:

| Component | Definition | Criteria |
|-----------|------------|----------|
| Objectives | What we want to achieve | Qualitative, inspiring, time-bound |
| Key Results | How we know we achieved it | Quantitative, measurable, specific |

**Implementation:**

| Phase | Actions |
|-------|---------|
| Pilot | Start with one team; learn the process |
| Expand | Roll out by function/team over 2-3 quarters |
| Scale | Company-wide OKRs with cascading alignment |

**Cadence:** Quarterly setting, weekly tracking, monthly review.

**Visibility:** All OKRs visible to everyone. "When you meet someone at Google, you read their OKRs."

### Step 3: Design Default-to-Open Systems

Shift from "need to know" to "no reason to hide":

| Information Type | Default | Restrict When |
|------------------|---------|---------------|
| Company goals/OKRs | Open | Never |
| Financial metrics | Open | Pre-IPO specifics |
| Individual goals | Open | Never |
| Project status | Open | Competitive sensitivity |
| Meeting notes | Open | Personnel matters |

**Implementation:**
- Internal wiki/docs accessible by default
- All-hands with open Q&A
- Metrics dashboards visible company-wide
- Explicit reasoning when something is restricted

### Step 4: Redesign Decision-Making

Create systems where data wins:

| Element | Implementation |
|---------|----------------|
| Clear owners | Every decision has one owner |
| Data requirements | Key decisions require data, not just opinions |
| Challenge rights | Anyone can challenge with data |
| Speed expectations | Decisions in days, not weeks |
| Decision records | Capture what, why, data used |

**Meeting structure:**
- Owner presents data and recommendation
- Discussion time-boxed
- Decision made in meeting (not later)
- Disagree and commit after decision

### Step 5: Build Data Capability

Culture requires capability:

| Capability | How to Build |
|------------|--------------|
| Metric literacy | Train everyone on key metrics |
| Data access | Self-serve dashboards and tools |
| Analysis skills | Invest in data science / analytics |
| Data quality | Single source of truth |

**Warning:** Culture fails if people want data but cannot get it.

### Step 6: Reinforce Through Leadership

Model the behavior:

| Leader Behavior | Why It Matters |
|-----------------|----------------|
| Ask "What's the data?" | Signals data requirement |
| Defer to data, not rank | Models desired behavior |
| Publicly change mind when data changes | Shows integrity |
| Praise data-driven challenges | Encourages speaking up |
| Celebrate learning from failed experiments | Removes fear |

## Outputs

| Output | Format |
|--------|--------|
| Culture Diagnosis | Current state assessment |
| OKR Implementation Plan | Pilot + rollout timeline |
| Transparency Policies | What's open, what's restricted, why |
| Decision-Making Framework | Process with data requirements |
| Capability Building Plan | Training and tooling needs |

## Error Handling

| Situation | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| No data infrastructure | Build capability first; cannot have data culture without data |
| Leadership resistance | Start bottom-up; demonstrate value in pilot |
| Analysis paralysis | Emphasize speed; "quick decision > slow perfection" |
| Weaponized data | Address culture/trust issues first |
| Competitive concerns | Use access controls for sensitive data; most info is not sensitive |

---

## Constraints

- Never design systems that use data to surveil or punish employees
- Never create metrics that measure vanity over value
- Never recommend transparency that violates privacy or security
- Culture requires capability—cannot have data culture without data access
- Leaders must model behavior—asking "what's the data?" publicly and repeatedly
- Speed matters—quick decisions beat slow decisions even when occasionally wrong

---

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

| Anti-Pattern | Why It Fails | Better Approach |
|--------------|--------------|-----------------|
| **HiPPO Culture** | Highest-Paid Person's Opinion wins regardless of evidence. Data becomes decoration. | Create explicit norm: when data contradicts opinion, data wins. Model publicly. |
| **Analysis Paralysis** | Requiring perfect data before any decision. Speed dies. | "Quick decision > slow perfection." Set time limits. Decide with best available data. |
| **Weaponized Data** | Using data to attack people rather than inform decisions. | Address trust issues first. Data culture requires psychological safety. |
| **Transparency Theater** | Sharing data broadly but not acting on it. | Visible accountability for data-informed decisions. Track and report. |
| **Metric Gaming** | Optimizing what's measured rather than what matters. | Review metrics regularly. Kill metrics that are being gamed. |

## Example

**Input:** "We're a 200-person company where the CEO makes all decisions. VPs bring opinions to meetings but nothing is data-driven. How do we change this?"

**Output:**

### Culture Diagnosis

**Current state:** HiPPO culture
- CEO decides; VPs advocate positions
- Information flows up; decisions flow down
- No visible metrics or OKRs
- Decisions take 2-3 weeks minimum

### 90-Day Transformation Plan

**Month 1: OKR Pilot**

Week 1: Train VP team on OKRs
- 3-5 company Objectives
- 3-4 Key Results each
- Make them visible immediately

Week 2-4: Pilot with one function
- That VP owns full OKR rollout for their team
- Weekly tracking meetings with data
- Document learnings

**Month 2: Decision-Making Reform**

New meeting structure for leadership team:
- Owner presents: "Here is my recommendation, and here is the data"
- Discussion: 15 minutes max per topic
- CEO: "What does the data suggest?" (not "Here's what I think")
- Decision: Made in meeting

New norm: When data contradicts opinion, data wins.

CEO commitment: Publicly defer to data 3+ times per month (be visible about it).

**Month 3: Default-to-Open**

- Create internal dashboard with key metrics
- All OKRs visible company-wide
- Weekly email: "What we learned this week" with data
- All-hands with live Q&A and real answers

### Success Metrics

| Metric | Current | 90-Day Target |
|--------|---------|---------------|
| Decision time | 2-3 weeks | <1 week |
| Decisions with data | ~20% | >60% |
| OKR visibility | 0% | 100% |
| CEO "what's the data" moments | 0 | Daily |

## Integration

This skill is extracted from the **Eric Schmidt** expert. Use Schmidt's voice when applying:
- Frame data culture as accountability without bureaucracy
- Emphasize speed: quick decisions beat slow decisions
- Remember: "We run the company on questions, not answers"
- Data creates accountability without adding layers
