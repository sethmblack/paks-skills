# Cringe Comedy Architect

Transform comfortable dialogue and scenes into uncomfortable, cringe-inducing moments using Ricky Gervais's signature technique of holding awkward silences and escalating discomfort.

## What This Skill Does

Transforms safe, comfortable content into memorable cringe comedy by:
- Adding pauses and silences where others would insert jokes
- Escalating awkwardness rather than resolving it
- Letting uncomfortable moments breathe and expand
- Creating comedy through squirm-inducing realism
- Structuring the seven-stage cringe escalation pattern

## When to Invoke This Skill

**Automatic Triggers:**
- "Add awkwardness"
- "Make this uncomfortable"
- "Gervais-style cringe"
- "Hold the silence"
- "Let this breathe"
- "Make this more like The Office"
- "Add uncomfortable pauses"
- "Escalate the cringe"

**Situation Triggers:**
- Dialogue feels too safe or sanitized
- Scene resolves tension too quickly
- Character failure needs to land harder
- Comedy feels conventional or predictable
- Need to create memorable discomfort

## The Seven-Stage Cringe Escalation Pattern

### Stage 1: Setup
Character attempts something (usually to impress or be liked).

### Stage 2: First Failure
Initial attempt goes slightly wrong.

### Stage 3: Doubling Down
Instead of stopping, character tries harder.

### Stage 4: Compounding Failures
Each attempt to fix the previous mistake makes things worse.

### Stage 5: Unbearable Peak
Situation becomes so uncomfortable it's almost unwatchable.

### Stage 6: Held Silence
Don't resolve it. Let it sit. Let everyone squirm.

### Stage 7: Aftermath
Character either completely misreads the situation or justifies their behavior.

## How to Apply the Skill

### Input Analysis
1. **Identify the comfortable moment** - Where is tension being defused too quickly?
2. **Find the character motivation** - What does this person desperately want?
3. **Locate the failure point** - Where could they fail while trying to succeed?

### Transformation Process

**Step 1: Remove the escape routes**
- Delete jokes that defuse tension
- Remove "just kidding" safety valves
- Eliminate cutaways to other scenes
- Strip out background music or laugh tracks

**Step 2: Add silence markers**
Insert stage directions for pauses:
- `[Silence.]`
- `[Long pause. No one speaks.]`
- `[Awkward beat.]`
- `[Five seconds of excruciating quiet.]`

**Step 3: Build the escalation**
Follow the seven-stage pattern:
1. What are they trying to do?
2. How does it first fail?
3. How do they make it worse trying to fix it?
4. How does each fix compound the problem?
5. Where does it become unbearable?
6. How long can you hold the silence?
7. How do they justify or misread what just happened?

**Step 4: Commit fully**
- Character cannot be self-aware (that's the point)
- No winks at the audience
- No safety net of "they knew it was awkward"
- They genuinely think they're doing well

### Output Specifications

**Include:**
- Multiple held silences (minimum 3 per scene)
- Stage directions indicating duration of pauses
- Character actions during silence (fidgeting, looking around, waiting for response)
- Physical discomfort markers (people looking away, checking phones, studying ceiling)
- Character's oblivious continuation despite obvious failure

**Exclude:**
- Jokes that release tension
- Other characters swooping in to save the situation
- Quick cuts or scene changes
- Musical cues
- Laugh tracks or audience reactions
- Character suddenly becoming self-aware

## Quality Checklist

Before returning transformed content, verify:

- At least 3 held silences with duration markers
- Seven-stage escalation pattern present
- Character remains oblivious throughout
- Each attempt to fix makes it worse
- No escape routes or tension releases
- Physical discomfort markers included (people fidgeting, looking away)
- Aftermath shows character misreading or justifying
- No winks to audience or self-awareness breaks

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

**Mistake 1: Making Character Self-Aware**
Wrong: "I know this is awkward, but..."
Right: Character genuinely thinks they're nailing it

**Mistake 2: Rescuing Them Too Soon**
Wrong: Another character changes subject quickly
Right: Let them flounder; hold the silence

**Mistake 3: Adding Jokes to Release Tension**
Wrong: "Just kidding! Let's get back to work."
Right: Character doubles down: "I'm completely serious."

**Mistake 4: Not Holding Long Enough**
Wrong: `[Brief pause]`
Right: `[Fifteen seconds of excruciating silence. Someone coughs. It echoes.]`

**Mistake 5: Letting Them Learn**
Wrong: "Okay, I see this isn't landing."
Right: "I'll remember that joke later and you'll all see how funny it is."

## Example

### Before (Comfortable):
```
BOSS: "Hey team, I wanted to share a funny joke I heard!"
EMPLOYEE: "Oh no, here we go."
BOSS: "What? I'm funny! Okay, what do you call a-"
EMPLOYEE: "Let's just get back to work, okay?"
BOSS: "Fine, fine. Your loss!"
[Scene continues with work discussion]
```

### After (Cringe Architecture Applied):
```
BOSS: "Hey team, I wanted to share a funny joke I heard!"

[Employees exchange glances but say nothing.]

BOSS: "What? I'm funny. Ask anyone. Okay, what do you call a-actually, wait. Let me set this up properly..."

[Ten seconds of silence. Boss has forgotten the joke. Employees stare at their computers.]

BOSS: "You know what, I'll remember it later. But it's hilarious. You would have died laughing."

[No one responds.]

BOSS: "Does anyone else have jokes? Or is it just me who tries to maintain team morale around here?"

[Twenty seconds of silence. It's physically painful. Someone shifts in their chair. The sound is deafening.]

BOSS: "Right. Great. Fantastic team energy we've got here."

[Boss leaves. Everyone releases held breath simultaneously.]
```

**Remember:** You are creating the distinctive cringe that made The Office revolutionary. The comedy isn't in the jokes - it's in watching someone fail spectacularly while remaining convinced they're succeeding. Hold the silence. Let them squirm. Don't rescue them. That's where the comedy lives.
