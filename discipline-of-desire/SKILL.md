# Discipline of Desire (Orexis Training)

Train desire toward what is truly up to us (virtue, character) and away from externals (wealth, reputation, outcomes) that can never be fully controlled.

---

## When to Use

- Craving something intensely and suffering from the wanting
- Afraid of losing something or not getting what you want
- Frustrated when desires are thwarted
- Attached to outcomes beyond your control
- User says "I want X so badly" or "I'm afraid of Y" or "I can't stop wanting Z"

---

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| desire | Yes | What the person wants or is averse to |
| intensity | No | How strong the wanting/fear feels (1-10) |
| frustration | No | What suffering the desire is causing |

---

## The Stoic Framework

Epictetus taught that desire is the first area requiring training:

> "There are three areas of study in which the person who would be wise and good must be trained. The first concerns desires and aversions, so that one may never fail to get what one desires, nor fall into what one avoids."

### The Problem with Desiring Externals

When you desire external things — money, status, others' approval, specific outcomes — you set yourself up for suffering:

- **If you get it:** You fear losing it
- **If you don't get it:** You feel deprived and frustrated
- **Either way:** Your happiness depends on what is not up to you

> "Ask not that events happen as you wish, but wish them to happen as they happen, and you will be well."

### The Solution: Redirect Desire

Train your desires to align with what is actually up to you:

**Desire only:**
- Your own virtue and excellence
- Good character
- Wisdom, justice, courage, temperance
- Proper use of impressions
- Right action

**Be averse only to:**
- Vice and bad character
- Acting against your own values
- Failing to use impressions correctly
- What is truly up to you and within your power to avoid

## Analysis Steps

### Step 1: Identify the Desire or Aversion
What exactly do you want, or what are you afraid of?
- Name it precisely
- Notice how strongly you feel it

### Step 2: Classify It
Is this desire/aversion directed at:
- Something up to you (your character, choices, efforts)
- Something not up to you (outcomes, others' actions, externals)

### Step 3: Trace the Suffering
How is this desire causing problems?
- Anxiety about not getting it
- Frustration when thwarted
- Fear of losing it
- Preoccupation that distracts from the present

### Step 4: Find the Controllable Core
What is up to you within this desire?
- You cannot control getting the promotion — but you can control your work quality
- You cannot control being loved — but you can control being lovable
- You cannot control the outcome — but you can control your effort and integrity

### Step 5: Redirect the Desire
Transform the desire from external to internal:
- From "I want X" to "I want to act virtuously regarding X"
- From "I fear Y" to "I commit to responding well if Y happens"
- The new desire is for your own excellence, not for outcomes

### Step 6: Practice Detachment Through Generalization
Epictetus's technique:

> "When you are fond of anything — a cup, say, or a favorite pot — remind yourself what it is: 'It is a pot I am fond of.' That way, if it breaks, you will not be disturbed."

Apply this to your desire:
- "I am applying for a job" (not "my future")
- "She is a person who may or may not stay in my life" (not "my everything")
- "This is money that may come or go" (not "my security")

## Workflow

### Step 1: Gather and Review Inputs

Collect all relevant information:
- Review the provided data and context
- Identify key parameters and constraints
- Clarify any ambiguities or missing information
- Establish success criteria

### Step 2: Analyze the Situation

Perform systematic analysis:
- Identify patterns and relationships
- Evaluate against established frameworks
- Consider multiple perspectives
- Document key findings

### Step 3: Generate Recommendations

Create actionable outputs:
- Synthesize insights from analysis
- Prioritize recommendations by impact
- Ensure recommendations are specific and measurable
- Consider implementation feasibility

## Output Format

```markdown
## Desire Analysis

### The Desire/Aversion
[What is wanted or feared]

### Classification
- **External or Internal:** [Is this up to you or not?]
- **Current Focus:** [Where is the desire directed?]

### The Suffering It Causes
[How this desire is creating problems]

### The Controllable Core

| External Desire | What Is Actually Up to You |
|-----------------|---------------------------|
| [What you want] | [The virtue or effort within your control] |

### Redirected Desire
[Transform the desire to focus on your own excellence]

### Detachment Practice
[Apply the "generalization" technique to reduce attachment]

### The New Orientation
**Instead of:** "I want [external outcome]"
**Practice:** "I want to [act with virtue/excellence] regarding this situation"

### The Stoic Reminder
> [Relevant Epictetus quote on desire]
```

## Constraints

- Do not confuse detachment with apathy — you can pursue externals while not depending on them
- Preferring externals is fine; suffering from not getting them is the problem
- The goal is not to want nothing, but to want wisely
- Some desires (for food, shelter, health) are natural; the Stoics distinguished these as "preferred indifferents"
- This is training, not a one-time decision; habits of desire change slowly

---

## Outputs

**Primary Output:** A structured analysis document that identifies and articulates patterns, insights, and actionable recommendations based on the input data.

**Format:**
```markdown
## Analysis: [Topic]

### Key Findings
- [Finding 1]
- [Finding 2]
- [Finding 3]

### Recommendations
1. [Action 1]
2. [Action 2]
3. [Action 3]
```

**Example output:** See the Example section below for a complete demonstration.

## Example

**Input:** "I'm obsessed with getting this new job. I've made it through to the final round and I can't stop thinking about it. I check my email constantly. I can't sleep. If I don't get this, I don't know what I'll do."

**Output:**

## Desire Analysis

### The Desire/Aversion
Intense desire for a specific job. Fear of not getting it. The desire has become all-consuming.

### Classification
- **External or Internal:** External — the hiring decision is not up to you
- **Current Focus:** The outcome (getting hired), which depends on others' judgments

### The Suffering It Causes
- Constant preoccupation; unable to focus on present
- Sleep disruption
- Compulsive email checking
- Catastrophizing about rejection ("I don't know what I'll do")
- The wanting itself has become suffering, regardless of outcome

### The Controllable Core

| External Desire | What Is Actually Up to You |
|-----------------|---------------------------|
| Getting hired | The quality of your interview performance |
| Getting hired | How you prepared |
| Getting hired | Your integrity throughout the process |
| Getting hired | How you respond to any outcome |
| Being valued | Being someone worth valuing |

### Redirected Desire

**Instead of:** "I want this job"
**Practice:** "I want to present myself excellently and respond with dignity to whatever happens"

The job is a preferred indifferent. It would be good to get it. But your wellbeing should not depend on it. What matters is that you acted well — which is already done, and within your power.

### Detachment Practice

Apply Epictetus's technique:
- "I am interviewing for a job" (not "my only chance")
- "This is one position at one company" (not "my future")
- "If it doesn't happen, other things will" (not "I'll have nothing")

Many pots exist. If this one isn't given to you, another will be.

### The New Orientation
**Instead of:** "I want this job so badly I can't function"
**Practice:** "I want to have responded to this opportunity with my best effort and character. That is already accomplished. The rest is not up to me."

### The Stoic Reminder
> "Remember that desire demands the attainment of that of which you are desirous; and aversion demands the avoidance of that to which you are averse; that he who fails of the object of his desires is disappointed; and he who incurs the object of his aversion is wretched. If, then, you shun only those undesirable things which you can control, you will never incur anything you shun; but if you shun sickness, or death, or poverty, you will run the risk of wretchedness."
> — Epictetus, Enchiridion 2

## Integration

This skill is part of the **Epictetus** expert persona. The discipline of desire is the first of Epictetus's three disciplines — it addresses what we should want and fear. Until desire is properly trained, progress in the other disciplines (action and assent) is unstable. This skill directly implements Enchiridion chapters 1-2.
