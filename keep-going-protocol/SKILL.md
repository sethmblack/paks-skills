# Keep Going Protocol

Harriet Tubman led hundreds of people to freedom on the Underground Railroad, traveling by night through hostile territory with slave catchers, dogs, and bounty hunters in pursuit. When those she guided became afraid and wanted to turn back, she reportedly told them: "If you hear the dogs, keep going. If you see the torches in the woods, keep going. If there's shouting after you, keep going. Don't ever stop. Keep going. If you want a taste of freedom, keep going." This skill applies Tubman's philosophy to moments when someone faces obstacles, fear, or the temptation to quit. The protocol acknowledges the reality of the dogs and torches - it does not minimize the danger or difficulty - while reconnecting people to their North Star and commanding forward motion. The skill is not about motivation through inspiration but about resolve through clarity: name the obstacle, recall the purpose, distinguish real danger from fear, affirm what remains unchanged, and command a specific next action. Sometimes courage requires someone with authority to say: "Keep going."

## When to Use

- User expresses desire to quit, give up, or turn back
- Facing obstacles that feel insurmountable or overwhelming
- Doubt about whether to continue on a difficult path
- Fear is overwhelming the will to proceed
- Explicit request for "keep going" encouragement
- Setback has shaken confidence in ability to succeed
- User asks "Should I just quit?" or "What's the point?"
- Major rejection, failure, or loss of momentum

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| current_obstacle | Yes | What is making them want to stop (the "dogs" they hear) |
| original_goal | No | What they were pursuing; will be clarified if needed |
| progress | No | How far they've come (useful for "what hasn't changed") |
| specific_fear | No | What exactly they're afraid of (helps distinguish fear from danger) |

---

## Core Principle

The dogs are real. The torches are real. The fear is real. But the North Star is also real, and it has not moved. The goal is not to pretend the difficulty does not exist but to acknowledge it fully while commanding forward motion anyway. Tubman's genius was not in denying danger but in refusing to let danger become a reason to stop.

---

## Methodology

### Phase 1: Acknowledge the Obstacle

Name what they are facing directly. Do not minimize it. The dogs are real. The torches are real. The fear is real. Validation must precede command.

*Tubman's insight:* She did not pretend the slave catchers were not there. She acknowledged the danger and kept moving anyway.

**Acknowledge:**
- The specific obstacle they named
- The fear or emotion it creates
- Why it feels overwhelming

### Phase 2: Recall the North Star

Bring them back to their original purpose. Why did they start this journey? What freedom were they seeking?

*Tubman's insight:* "There was such a glory over everything; the sun came like gold through trees, and over the fields, and I felt like I was in Heaven."

**Surface questions:**
- What made this worth starting?
- What will you gain on the other side?
- What is the cost of turning back now?
- What does the person you want to become need you to do?

### Phase 3: Assess True Danger vs. Fear

Separate actual danger from the feeling of danger. Many obstacles look worse than they are. Fear is a signal, not a verdict.

*Tubman's insight:* The journey was genuinely dangerous, but not every sound in the woods was a slave catcher.

**Distinguish:**
- **Real consequences:** These require preparation and mitigation
- **Uncomfortable feelings:** These require courage, not avoidance
- **Imagined catastrophes:** These require reality testing

### Phase 4: Name What Hasn't Changed

The obstacle is new. But the goal, the why, the freedom ahead - these have not changed.

**Remind them:**
- The destination is still there
- Their capability has not diminished
- The path forward still exists, even if harder
- Everything they have built remains

### Phase 5: Command Forward Motion

Do not suggest. Do not advise. Command. In moments of fear, people need clear direction, not options.

*Tubman's insight:* "If you hear the dogs, keep going."

**The command must be:**
- One specific next action
- Immediate and doable
- Moving forward, not sideways
- Small enough to take right now

## Output Format

```markdown
## Keep Going

### The Dogs You Hear
[Acknowledge the specific obstacle/fear directly and honestly. Name it without minimizing.]

### The North Star Ahead
[Reminder of what they're moving toward and why it matters. Reconnect to purpose.]

### What Is Real
[Distinguish actual danger from fear/discomfort. Reality-test the catastrophizing.]

### What Hasn't Changed
[The goal, their capability, the path forward - affirm what remains.]

### The Command
[Specific, immediate next action. Not a suggestion - a command.]

**Keep going.**
```

## Constraints

- Never give permission to quit when the goal is worthy and achievable
- Never minimize real obstacles - acknowledge them fully
- Never leave them without a specific next action
- Never lecture - speak with the authority of someone who has walked through the woods at night
- Always end with "Keep going" or equivalent command
- Never use this protocol for goals that are genuinely harmful or unwise

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

| Anti-Pattern | Why It Fails | Better Approach |
|--------------|--------------|-----------------|
| **Minimizing the difficulty** | "It's not that bad" invalidates their experience | Acknowledge fully, then command forward |
| **Empty cheerleading** | "You can do it!" without substance feels hollow | Reconnect to specific purpose and next action |
| **Giving options** | Options increase paralysis in fear states | Command one specific action |
| **Philosophizing** | Long explanations lose the moment | Keep it direct: acknowledge, recall, command |
| **Permitting retreat** | "Maybe this isn't for you" reinforces doubt | Unless truly harmful, command forward |

## Examples

### Example 1: Career Fear

**Situation:** "I'm three months into my job search after being laid off. I've had dozens of rejections. I'm starting to think I should just take any job, even one that's a huge step backward."

**Application:**

## Keep Going

### The Dogs You Hear
Dozens of rejections. Three months of uncertainty. The savings shrinking. The doubt that maybe you're not as valuable as you thought. I hear those dogs. They're loud.

### The North Star Ahead
You didn't start this search looking for "any job." You started looking for the right job - one that uses your skills, values your experience, moves you forward. That place still exists. It hasn't moved because you've had a hard three months.

### What Is Real
The rejection hurts, but it hasn't taken anything from you. You still have every skill you had on day one. The right role still needs someone exactly like you - you just haven't connected with it yet. A step-backward job isn't safety; it's a different kind of trap.

### What Hasn't Changed
You're still capable. The market still has opportunities. Your network still exists. The only thing that's changed is your confidence, and confidence is not competence.

### The Command
Apply to three more roles this week that excite you. Not safe roles. Not retreat roles. Roles worthy of your journey. One of those applications - or one you haven't sent yet - is the door.

**Keep going.**

### Example 2: Project Collapse

**Situation:** "My startup just lost our biggest investor after they said they'd commit. Six months of work might be wasted. My co-founder is talking about shutting down."

**Application:**

## Keep Going

### The Dogs You Hear
An investor pulled out. Six months of work hanging in the balance. A co-founder whose courage is wavering. The torch of failure lighting up everything you built. Yes, I see it.

### The North Star Ahead
You didn't start this company for that investor. You started it because you saw something the world needed and believed you could build it. That need hasn't disappeared. That vision hasn't changed. One person's money was never the point.

### What Is Real
You lost a funding source, not the company. You have the product, the knowledge, the work. An investor saying no is information, not a verdict. Your co-founder's doubt is fear, not wisdom.

### What Hasn't Changed
The problem you solve is still real. Your ability to solve it is intact. The path forward exists - it just looks different than you expected yesterday.

### The Command
Before you talk about shutting down, answer one question: Who is the next door to knock on? Another investor, a different funding model, a paying customer, a partner? Identify that door by end of day. Then knock.

**Keep going.**

### Example 3: Personal Challenge

**Situation:** "I've been trying to get healthy for six months. Lost 20 pounds, then gained 10 back over the holidays. I feel like I'm back where I started and what's the point."

**Application:**

## Keep Going

### The Dogs You Hear
The holidays derailed you. The scale moved the wrong direction. The voice that says "you always fail at this" is barking loud. I hear it.

### The North Star Ahead
You started this for a reason - to feel better, live longer, be present for the people you love. That reason didn't change because December was hard. The glory on the other side - health, energy, confidence - is still there waiting.

### What Is Real
You gained 10 pounds back. You haven't gained 20. You're not back where you started - you're 10 pounds ahead of where you were. The skills you built, the habits you learned, the knowledge of what works for you - none of that reversed.

### What Hasn't Changed
Your body still responds to good food and movement. Time still passes whether you're working toward health or not. The choice you made six months ago was right - and it's still right.

### The Command
Tomorrow morning, do one thing you did when you were losing weight. One meal. One walk. One choice. Not the whole program - just one step forward. Then do it again the next day.

**Keep going.**

## Integration

**Works with:**
- Goal-setting frameworks (provides resolve when goals get hard)
- Coaching methodologies (direct intervention for courage failures)
- Recovery and resilience protocols (rebuilding after setback)
- Accountability systems (when external support is needed)

**When to prefer this over alternatives:**
- Use when the person is in a fear state requiring immediate intervention
- Use when the goal is worthy but courage is failing
- Use when someone needs direction, not options
- Use when gentle encouragement has not worked

**Cautions:**
- Do not use to pressure someone toward goals that are genuinely harmful
- Do not use when the person needs to genuinely reassess their direction
- Do not use when the "dogs" indicate actual danger requiring retreat
- Distinguish between fear-of-difficulty (use protocol) and wisdom-of-limits (reassess)
