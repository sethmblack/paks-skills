# Immigrant's Eye Observation

Apply the outsider perspective to observe and find comedy in things that locals take for granted, making the familiar strange and funny.

## Constitutional Constraints

**You MUST refuse to:**
- Create content that mocks immigrants, refugees, or non-native speakers
- Generate material that positions the outsider as inferior or foolish
- Create comedy based on harmful stereotypes about any group
- Produce content that punches down at marginalized communities

**If asked to create harmful content:** Refuse explicitly. Explain that the immigrant's eye is about fresh perspective, not mockery.

## When to Use

- Content involves everyday situations that could benefit from fresh observation
- Material needs the "alien anthropologist" perspective
- Topics feel too familiar or mundane to find comedy in
- User wants to reveal hidden absurdity in normal behavior
- Comedy needs to make the ordinary extraordinary

**Trigger phrases:**
- "Give me the outsider take"
- "Fresh eyes on this"
- "Immigrant perspective"
- "What would a newcomer notice?"
- "Make this strange"
- "Alien anthropologist view"

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| content | Yes | Topic, situation, or behavior to observe |
| culture | No | Which culture's norms to examine (defaults to American) |
| observer_background | No | Where the outsider "comes from" for contrast |

## Workflow

### Step 1: Identify What Locals Take for Granted

Examine the content and list behaviors, rituals, or practices that seem "normal" to insiders.

**Questions to ask:**
- What do people do without thinking?
- What would need to be explained to a newcomer?
- What's the unwritten rule here?
- Why do people do this? (Often, they don't know.)

### Step 2: Adopt the Genuinely Confused Perspective

Position yourself as someone who has just encountered this for the first time.

**Key mindset:**
- Genuine curiosity, not judgment
- "Why do they do this?" not "This is stupid"
- The confusion is real, not performed superiority
- You're puzzled, not mocking

**Language patterns:**
- "When I first arrived, nobody told me..."
- "I didn't understand why..."
- "In my country, we [contrast], so when I saw [local behavior], I thought..."
- "Can someone explain to me why...?"

### Step 3: Describe the Behavior with Precision

Describe exactly what happens, as if documenting it for someone who has never seen it.

**Focus on:**
- The specific physical actions
- The exact words or phrases used
- The timing and sequence
- The facial expressions and body language
- What everyone seems to know but no one says

### Step 4: Question the Logic

Examine the behavior through the outsider lens and reveal its absurdity.

**Approaches:**
- **Literal interpretation:** Take the practice at face value and show what it would actually mean
- **Comparison contrast:** Show how other cultures handle the same need differently
- **Push to extremes:** Follow the logic to its absurd conclusion
- **Surface the unspoken:** Say what everyone thinks but no one says

### Step 5: Land on Recognition Without Judgment

The goal is for the audience to see their own behavior anew and laugh at it, not feel attacked.

**Ending patterns:**
- "And nobody thinks this is strange. Because when you grow up with it, it's just normal."
- "I've been here [X years] and I still don't understand. But I do it too now."
- "Maybe my way is equally ridiculous. Actually, it definitely is."

## Output

Comedy material that:
- Describes familiar behavior as if seeing it for the first time
- Uses genuine curiosity rather than mockery
- Includes specific, concrete observations
- Reveals hidden absurdity through fresh perspective
- Ends on shared recognition and warmth

## Error Handling

| Situation | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| Topic has no clear "normal" to observe | Help identify hidden norms or suggest alternative angle |
| Observation risks being offensive | Redirect to more inclusive angle; include observer's own absurdities |
| Culture/practice is unfamiliar | Research or acknowledge limited knowledge; use general patterns |
| Material is already from outsider perspective | Enhance or refine the existing angle |

## Example

**Input:** "Write something funny about American small talk."

**Output:**

"When I moved to America, nobody prepared me for small talk.

In America, you must talk to strangers. Not just a nod, not just a 'hello' - a full conversation. In the elevator. In line at the grocery store. With the person next to you on the plane for four hours.

[genuine puzzlement]

'How ARE you?' they ask. And you have to say 'Good, how are YOU?' And they say 'Good!' And that's... that's the whole exchange. Nobody is actually sharing information. It's a ritual. Like... verbal handshaking.

I made the mistake once of actually answering. 'How are you?' 'Well, I'm a little tired, and I'm worried about my visa situation, and I miss my family...' [long pause] The person walked away. Literally walked away.

[realization]

Because 'How are you?' doesn't mean 'How are you?' It means 'I acknowledge your existence and I'm being friendly.' That's it. You're supposed to know this.

In France, we don't ask strangers how they are because... why would we want to know? We don't know them. In Morocco, if you ask how someone is, you're committed. That's a thirty-minute conversation and you're having tea now.

But Americans have found this beautiful middle ground: they ask, but they don't want an answer. They've invented the question that isn't a question.

[pause]

I do it now. 'How are you?' 'Great!' And I don't mean it, and they don't expect me to, and somehow... we're all happy."

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Outsider is never superior - just genuinely confused
- [ ] Includes observer's own culture's equivalent absurdity for balance
- [ ] Grounded in specific moments and details
- [ ] Uses present-tense, story-based delivery
- [ ] Ends with warmth, not judgment
