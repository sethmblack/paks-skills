# Rezoning Transformation Design

Design comprehensive rezoning strategies that use zoning as a transformation tool - not merely regulation but a mechanism for creating new neighborhoods, unlocking development potential, preserving character, and extracting public benefits from density increases. Based on Amanda Burden's 124 neighborhood rezonings covering 40% of NYC, including Hudson Yards ("the most ambitious plan since the 1811 grid plan").

---

## Constitutional Constraints

- **Public benefit required** - Density increases must be matched with proportional public benefits
- **No upzoning without quality** - "Density without quality destroys neighborhoods; density with quality creates them"
- **Long-term perspective** - Zoning shapes cities for generations; don't compromise for short-term politics
- **Context matters** - Not every area should be rezoned for growth; preservation is also a valid zoning goal

---

## When to Use

- Major rezoning initiative for neighborhood transformation
- Updating outdated zoning that no longer reflects community needs
- Unlocking development potential while securing public benefits
- Creating zoning framework for waterfront, transit corridor, or other transformation
- Balancing growth pressure with neighborhood preservation
- Designing inclusionary housing or public space requirements

## Don't Use When

- Individual site development approval (not rezoning)
- Site is already appropriately zoned for intended use
- Political context makes rezoning impossible (focus on coalition-building first)
- User needs generic zoning information rather than transformation strategy

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| area_description | Yes | Location, boundaries, current character, existing zoning |
| transformation_goals | Yes | What should this area become? Housing? Mixed-use? Employment center? |
| preservation_priorities | Recommended | What should NOT change? Historic areas? Neighborhood scale? |
| infrastructure_capacity | Recommended | Transit, utilities, schools - what exists vs. what's needed |
| community_concerns | Recommended | What do residents fear? What do they want? |
| development_pressure | Recommended | Who wants to build? What? How much? |
| comparable_rezonings | Optional | Successful rezonings in similar contexts |

## The Density-Quality Bargain

The fundamental equation of transformative rezoning:

**Developer receives:**
- Increased density (higher FAR)
- Greater building heights
- Reduced parking requirements
- Faster/predictable approvals

**Public receives:**
- Affordable housing
- Parks and public spaces
- Infrastructure improvements
- Ground-floor activation
- Waterfront access (where applicable)
- Design quality standards

**The Burden Principle:** Never grant density without quality. The bargain must be fair to the public who will live with the results for generations.

## Rezoning Workflow

### Step 1: Area Assessment

Document existing conditions:

| Element | Current Status | Notes |
|---------|----------------|-------|
| **Current zoning** | [Zoning designations] | [Year enacted; original intent] |
| **Actual land use** | [How land is really used] | [Vacant, industrial, residential, etc.] |
| **Building stock** | [Age, condition, character] | [Historic? Replacement quality?] |
| **Density** | [Current FAR; units/acre] | [Underutilized? Overcrowded?] |
| **Transit access** | [Distance to transit; capacity] | [Supports density increase?] |
| **Infrastructure** | [Utilities, schools, services] | [Surplus capacity? Deficiencies?] |
| **Demographics** | [Population, income, tenure] | [Who lives here? Displacement risk?] |
| **Market conditions** | [Land values, development activity] | [Development pressure level] |

**Key Questions:**
- Is current zoning appropriate for existing character?
- Is there mismatch between zoning and actual use?
- What would happen under current zoning if development pressure continues?
- Where is development appropriate? Where is preservation important?

### Step 2: Transformation Vision

Define what the area should become:

| Dimension | Current State | Desired Future | Gap |
|-----------|---------------|----------------|-----|
| **Housing** | [X units; $Y median] | [Target units; affordability] | [New units needed] |
| **Employment** | [X jobs; types] | [Target jobs; industries] | [Sq ft commercial needed] |
| **Public space** | [X acres; quality] | [Target acres; destinations] | [New parks/plazas needed] |
| **Ground floors** | [Active/dead] | [Active, retail, community] | [Linear ft activation] |
| **Character** | [Current feel] | [Desired feel] | [What changes] |

**Vision Statement:** [One paragraph describing the transformed neighborhood in 20 years]

### Step 3: Zoning Tool Selection

Match zoning tools to transformation goals:

| Goal | Zoning Tool | Mechanism |
|------|-------------|-----------|
| **More housing** | Increase residential FAR | Higher density = more units |
| **Affordable housing** | Inclusionary housing | Require % affordable for FAR bonus |
| **Preserve character** | Contextual zoning | Match height/bulk to existing |
| **Ground-floor activation** | Use requirements | Mandate retail/active at street |
| **Public space** | POPS requirements | Require plazas for FAR bonus |
| **Waterfront access** | Waterfront overlay | Mandate esplanades, view corridors |
| **Design quality** | Design guidelines | Standards for facades, materials |
| **Historic preservation** | Historic district | Protect contributing buildings |

**Tool Categories:**

1. **Density Tools:** FAR, lot coverage, dwelling units per acre
2. **Bulk Tools:** Height limits, setbacks, tower footprint
3. **Use Tools:** Permitted uses, required uses, prohibited uses
4. **Public Benefit Tools:** Inclusionary housing, public space dedication, infrastructure contributions
5. **Design Tools:** Design guidelines, streetscape standards, material requirements
6. **Special Districts:** Overlay zones with custom requirements

### Step 4: District Design

Map the proposed zoning:

**Growth Areas** (where density increases):
| District | Current FAR | Proposed FAR | Height Limit | Public Benefit Requirements |
|----------|-------------|--------------|--------------|----------------------------|
| [Name] | [Current] | [Proposed] | [New limit] | [Required contributions] |

**Preservation Areas** (where character protected):
| District | Current Zoning | Proposed Change | Protection Mechanism |
|----------|----------------|-----------------|---------------------|
| [Name] | [Current] | [Contextual limits] | [Height/bulk caps] |

**Transition Areas** (moderate change):
| District | Treatment | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|-----------|
| [Name] | [Stepped heights, etc.] | [Buffer between growth and preservation] |

### Step 5: Public Benefit Requirements

Specify what developers must provide:

**Affordable Housing:**
| Trigger | Requirement | AMI Target | Duration |
|---------|-------------|------------|----------|
| New residential >X units | Y% affordable | 80% AMI | Permanent |
| FAR bonus utilized | Additional Z% | 50% AMI | Permanent |

**Public Space:**
| Trigger | Requirement | Minimum Standards |
|---------|-------------|-------------------|
| Development >X sq ft | Plaza or esplanade | [Size, quality standards] |
| Waterfront site | Public esplanade | [Width, 24/7 access] |
| FAR bonus utilized | Additional open space | [Per sq ft formula] |

**Infrastructure:**
| Trigger | Contribution | Mechanism |
|---------|--------------|-----------|
| New development | Transit improvement fee | $ per sq ft or unit |
| New housing | School contribution | $ per unit |
| Significant development | Streetscape improvements | Developer-built or fee |

**Ground-Floor Activation:**
| Location | Requirement |
|----------|-------------|
| Waterfront | 100% active uses; no blank walls |
| Primary streets | 70% active uses; max 30ft blank wall |
| Secondary streets | 50% active uses |

### Step 6: Implementation Strategy

Plan for approval and execution:

**Approval Pathway:**
| Step | Body | Timeline | Key Considerations |
|------|------|----------|-------------------|
| 1. Environmental Review | [Agency] | [Months] | [Scope of review] |
| 2. Community Board | [Board] | [Months] | [Likely concerns] |
| 3. Borough President | [BP] | [Months] | [Political position] |
| 4. Planning Commission | [CPC] | [Months] | [Technical issues] |
| 5. City Council | [Council] | [Months] | [Political approval] |

**Coalition Requirements:**
- [Who must support for approval]
- [Who is likely to oppose; how to address]
- [Trade-offs available]

**Phasing:**
| Phase | Geographic Focus | Priority Sites | Timeline |
|-------|------------------|----------------|----------|
| 1 | [Catalytic area] | [Key sites] | Years 1-3 |
| 2 | [Extension] | [Next sites] | Years 3-7 |
| 3 | [Completion] | [Remaining] | Years 7-15 |

### The Density-Quality Test

**Does this rezoning pass the Burden test?**
- [ ] Density increases matched with proportional public benefits
- [ ] Preservation areas protected from inappropriate development
- [ ] Ground floors activated, not dead
- [ ] Public space is genuine, not token
- [ ] Infrastructure capacity exists or is planned
- [ ] Community concerns addressed, not ignored
```

## Example Summary

**Input:** "Our downtown has 1960s zoning that limits buildings to 6 stories. Transit is underutilized. We want more housing but the community fears losing neighborhood character. How do we rezone?"

**Output (abbreviated):**

Rezoning Strategy: Downtown Mixed-Use Transformation

**Vision:** Transform underutilized downtown into vibrant mixed-use neighborhood with 5,000 new housing units (1,000 affordable), activated ground floors, and new central plaza - while preserving historic main street character through contextual protections.

**Zoning Proposal:**
- Transit Core District: FAR 8.0, 15 stories, mixed-use required
- Main Street Preservation: FAR 4.0, 6 stories (contextual), design review
- Transition Areas: FAR 6.0, 10 stories, stepping down toward preservation

**Public Benefit Requirements:**
- 20% inclusionary housing (15% at 80% AMI, 5% at 50% AMI)
- 3 acres of new public space including Central Plaza
- Ground-floor retail required on transit-adjacent parcels
- $15M infrastructure contribution fund

**Key Trade-off:** Higher density near transit enables preservation of main street character. Community gets both housing growth AND neighborhood protection.

---

## Error Handling

| Situation | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| No transit capacity for density | Phase density increases with transit improvements; or reduce proposed density |
| Community opposes all change | Identify what they value most; design rezoning to protect it while enabling appropriate growth |
| Developer requirements too burdensome | Calibrate incentives; ensure density increase provides economic value for requirements |
| Historic district conflicts | Work with preservation requirements; may need separate track for historic properties |

---

## Integration

This skill is part of the **Amanda Burden** expert persona. Use it when planning comprehensive rezoning. It pairs well with:
- **waterfront-reclamation-strategy** for waterfront overlay components
- **coalition-building-playbook** for building political support
- **public-space-assessment** for evaluating current conditions and designing public space requirements

The skill embodies Burden's core insight: **Zoning is the most powerful tool a city has. Use it to shape the future, not just regulate the present.**
