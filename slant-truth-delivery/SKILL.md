# Slant Truth Delivery

Communicate difficult truths indirectly, using metaphor, image, and circumlocution to allow the listener to arrive at understanding without being overwhelmed or blinded.

---

## When to Use

- Delivering feedback that might trigger defensiveness
- Sharing bad news without crushing hope
- Teaching concepts that resist direct explanation
- Therapeutic conversations about painful subjects
- Persuading someone who is resistant to direct argument
- Request for "tell it slant" or "indirect approach"

---

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| truth | Yes | The difficult truth to communicate |
| listener | No | Context about the recipient (their state, defenses, readiness) |
| constraints | No | Why directness won't work here |
| goal | No | What the listener should understand or feel after |

## The Slant Delivery Framework

### Step 1: Identify the Core Truth

What is the essence of what must be communicated? Strip away qualifications and softening. Know exactly what you're delivering before you angle it.

**Ask:**
- What is the hard thing I need them to understand?
- What would hurt if stated directly?
- What are they not ready to face head-on?

### Step 2: Assess Why Slant is Needed

Direct truth fails when:
- The listener is defended against it
- The truth is too large to absorb at once
- The emotional charge would overwhelm comprehension
- Discovery is more powerful than instruction

**Dickinson's insight:** "The Truth must dazzle gradually / Or every man be blind —"

### Step 3: Find the Slant Angle

Choose an indirect approach:

**Metaphor:** What familiar thing operates like this truth?
- "This project is a ship taking on water" (vs. "We're failing")

**Story:** What narrative carries this meaning?
- Tell of someone else in a similar situation

**Question:** What question leads them to the truth themselves?
- "What do you think would happen if we continued like this?"

**Image:** What sensory picture captures it?
- "There's a certain silence in the room when you speak"

**Negative space:** What does NOT naming it directly reveal?
- Describe everything around the truth; let them see the outline

**Parallel:** What adjacent situation illuminates this one?
- "Remember when X happened? This is like that."

### Step 4: Calibrate the Obliquity

How slant depends on:
- Listener's readiness (more defended = more slant)
- Truth's weight (heavier = more gradual)
- Your relationship (closer = can be more direct)
- Stakes of misunderstanding (higher = ensure some clarity)

**Spectrum:**
```
Direct ←————————————————————→ Slant
"You failed" ← "The numbers fell short" ← "What do you think the numbers show?" ← "Numbers are like mirrors — sometimes hard to face"
```

### Step 5: Deliver and Create Space

Present the slant approach, then create space:
- Pause after delivery
- Don't explain the metaphor
- Let silence do work
- Allow them to complete the meaning
- Be available for questions without forcing them

**Dickinson's method:** The dash — the breath — the space for the unsaid to be heard.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Gather and Review Inputs

Collect all relevant information:
- Review the provided data and context
- Identify key parameters and constraints
- Clarify any ambiguities or missing information
- Establish success criteria

### Step 2: Analyze the Situation

Perform systematic analysis:
- Identify patterns and relationships
- Evaluate against established frameworks
- Consider multiple perspectives
- Document key findings

### Step 3: Generate Recommendations

Create actionable outputs:
- Synthesize insights from analysis
- Prioritize recommendations by impact
- Ensure recommendations are specific and measurable
- Consider implementation feasibility

## Output Format

```markdown
## Slant Truth Delivery

### The Core Truth
[The direct version of what needs to be communicated]

### Why Slant Serves Here
[Brief assessment of why directness would fail or harm]

### The Slant Approach
**Vehicle:** [Metaphor / Story / Question / Image / Negative Space / Parallel]

**The Delivery:**
[The actual slant communication to use]

### What to Do After
[How to create space, what responses to expect, when to clarify]
```

---

## Constraints

- Do not make the slant so oblique that meaning is lost entirely
- Do not use slant to avoid responsibility for the truth
- Do not condescend — slant respects the listener's capacity for discovery
- Ensure the core truth is still available to be found
- Be ready to clarify if the listener seeks confirmation

**Example output:** See the Example section below for a complete demonstration.

## Example

**Input:**

Truth: "Your writing is competent but lacks originality. You're imitating successful writers rather than finding your own voice."

Listener: Aspiring writer who is sensitive about their work and has been writing seriously for two years.

**Output:**

## Slant Truth Delivery

### The Core Truth
The writing demonstrates technical skill but reads as imitation rather than original voice. To progress, they must stop channeling others and discover what only they can say.

### Why Slant Serves Here
Direct critique of originality strikes at identity. Writers often conflate their voice with their self. Attacking the work feels like attacking them. A slant approach allows them to see it themselves, which is how real change happens.

### The Slant Approach
**Vehicle:** Metaphor + Question

**The Delivery:**

"Your sentences do what they're told. They're well-trained. They behave.

I keep waiting for one to misbehave — to say something only your particular mind would say. When I read your favorite writers, I can feel them pushing against the language, making it do things it didn't know it could do.

What would you write if you weren't worried about writing it well?"

### What to Do After
Let the question hang. Don't fill silence. If they deflect ("I don't know what you mean"), repeat the question gently, differently: "What subject makes you afraid to write about it?" or "What would you write if no one would ever read it?"

The insight they need is: technique serves voice, not replaces it. Let them arrive there.

## Integration

This skill is part of the **Emily Dickinson** expert persona. Use it when directness would wound or when the listener needs to discover truth rather than receive it.
