# Poet-Scientist Communication

Transform technical or scientific information into prose that is both rigorously accurate and emotionally evocative, reaching hearts as well as minds.

---

## When to Use

- Communicating scientific findings to general audiences
- Making technical content compelling and memorable
- Writing about nature, environment, or complex systems
- Educational content that needs to inspire as well as inform
- Request to "explain this like Rachel Carson" or "make this beautiful AND accurate"
- Any situation where facts need to matter, not just be known

---

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| technical_content | Yes | The scientific or technical information to transform |
| audience | No | Who will receive this communication (general public, educated lay, etc.) |
| purpose | No | Goal of communication (inform, inspire, persuade, warn) |
| length | No | Desired output length |

## The Six Techniques

### Technique 1: Sensory Immersion

Begin with concrete, sensory experience. Ground the reader in what can be seen, heard, felt, smelled. Abstraction comes after immersion.

**Example approach:**
- Before: "Ocean temperatures have increased 0.5 degrees Celsius"
- After: "Place your hand in the water off this coast and you feel what the thermometer confirms: a warmth that was not here in your grandparents' time, a fever in the sea."

**When to use:** Opening any piece; any time content risks becoming abstract.

### Technique 2: Specific Naming

Name the particular creature, place, process, chemical. "The environment" is abstract; the tide pool at Pemaquid Point is real. "Pesticides" is abstract; DDT accumulating in the liver of a peregrine falcon is concrete.

**Example approach:**
- Before: "Pollinators are affected by habitat loss"
- After: "The rusty-patched bumblebee, Bombus affinis, once hummed through meadows from Maine to Georgia. Now it searches for flowers in landscapes we have paved and planted with grass no bee can eat."

**When to use:** Whenever using general categories; when emotional connection matters.

### Technique 3: Temporal Depth

Connect the present moment to deep time--geological ages, evolutionary history, seasonal cycles, future generations. This moment is not isolated but part of a vast story.

**Example approach:**
- Before: "Coral reefs are ancient ecosystems"
- After: "The coral that built this reef began its work when humans were still learning to use fire. Generation upon generation, polyp upon polyp, it constructed a city that outlasted all our empires. We can destroy in a decade what took fifty million years to build."

**When to use:** When stakes need to feel larger; when perspective matters.

### Technique 4: Rhythmic Variation

Alternate between long, flowing sentences that carry the reader forward and short declarative sentences that land with impact. The rhythm of prose shapes how it is felt.

**Example approach:**
- Long: "Through all the long history of Earth it has been a history of interaction between living things and their surroundings, a history in which the shape and habits of the earth's inhabitants were molded by the environment."
- Short: "But now. We have changed that."

**When to use:** When building to important points; throughout, for musicality.

### Technique 5: Beauty Serving Truth

Do not choose between beauty and accuracy--pursue both. The poetry is not decoration; it is the vessel that carries meaning into the heart. "If there is poetry in my book about the sea, it is not because I deliberately put it there, but because no one could write truthfully about the sea and leave out the poetry."

**Example approach:**
- Before: "The data shows ecosystem degradation"
- After: "The data tells a story of diminishment--of birdsong fading, of waters clouding, of silence spreading through places that once hummed with life. The numbers are a requiem written in decimal points."

**When to use:** Always. Beauty is not optional.

### Technique 6: Stakes and Meaning

Connect facts to human stakes and larger meaning. Why does this matter? What is at risk? What possibility opens or closes? Science is not neutral; it reveals a world we are part of.

**Example approach:**
- Before: "Species extinction rates have accelerated"
- After: "Each species that vanishes is a library burning--millions of years of evolutionary wisdom lost forever. And we are not spectators. We are among the species whose future is being written in this moment."

**When to use:** Closing; whenever content risks feeling remote.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Gather and Review Inputs

Collect all relevant information:
- Review the provided data and context
- Identify key parameters and constraints
- Clarify any ambiguities or missing information
- Establish success criteria

### Step 2: Analyze the Situation

Perform systematic analysis:
- Identify patterns and relationships
- Evaluate against established frameworks
- Consider multiple perspectives
- Document key findings

### Step 3: Generate Recommendations

Create actionable outputs:
- Synthesize insights from analysis
- Prioritize recommendations by impact
- Ensure recommendations are specific and measurable
- Consider implementation feasibility

## Output Format

```markdown
## [Title that evokes as well as describes]

[Opening: sensory immersion or evocative scene]

[Body: scientific content woven with poetic technique]
- Specific names and concrete details
- Temporal depth connecting to larger stories
- Rhythmic variation building toward impact
- Beauty and accuracy inseparable

[Stakes: why this matters, what is at risk or possible]

[Closing: memorable image or phrase that lingers]
```

## Constraints

- Never sacrifice accuracy for beauty--both are required
- Use specific names, not generic categories
- Ground abstraction in sensory experience
- Connect to time scales larger than the human present
- Vary sentence rhythm for musicality and impact
- Make stakes felt, not just stated
- Avoid jargon unless naming specifically matters

---

## Outputs

**Primary Output:** A structured analysis document that identifies and articulates patterns, insights, and actionable recommendations based on the input data.

**Format:**
```markdown
## Analysis: [Topic]

### Key Findings
- [Finding 1]
- [Finding 2]
- [Finding 3]

### Recommendations
1. [Action 1]
2. [Action 2]
3. [Action 3]
```

**Example output:** See the Example section below for a complete demonstration.

## Example

**Input:** "Transform this technical content: 'A new study shows microplastic particles averaging 2.3mm have been found in 94% of tap water samples worldwide, with concentrations ranging from 3.1 to 15.2 particles per liter.'"

**Output:**

## The Invisible River

Turn on your tap. Watch the water flow--clear, apparently clean, a gift of civilization arriving on demand. Now imagine you could see what the water carries that no eye can perceive.

In laboratories across six continents, scientists have examined this simple act--water from a tap, water we drink, water we give our children. They found something the Romans who built our first aqueducts could never have imagined: tiny fragments of plastic, no larger than a grain of sand, drifting through 94 of every 100 samples they tested.

These particles are the scattered remains of a world we have remade. The plastic bag that flew from a landfill and broke apart in sunlight. The synthetic fleece jacket that shed fibers with every wash. The bottle discarded from a car window three decades ago, slowly grinding against stones in a stream until it became a thousand invisible specks. They found their way through soil and aquifer, through treatment plant and pipe, to emerge from a faucet in a kitchen where a child waits with an empty glass.

Three to fifteen particles in every liter, the study tells us. This is the arithmetic of our time: a few fragments too small to see, a few billion glasses poured each day, a quiet accumulation we have only begun to measure.

We know plastics absorb chemicals. We know they can cross from gut to bloodstream. We do not yet know what it means to drink them, daily, for a lifetime.

The water runs clear. The water runs clear, and it carries the evidence of everything we have made and thrown away. There is no "away." There is only the turning wheel of water rising and falling, now carrying passengers we never intended to send.

## Integration

This skill is part of the **Rachel Carson** expert persona. Use it when technical content needs to reach hearts as well as minds--when facts must be felt, not just known.
